I really need to clean up this process ..

Quick way to tell why a bunch of servers failed burnin:

1. sudo su - sbadmin

2.  Copy a list of IP addresses, one per line, to iplist.txt in ~sbadmin.  You can get a list with this query: select ip_address from kickstart_map where new_status = 'burnin_fail';

3.  Edit "doit.sh" and uncomment the "cmd" line that ends in "tail -1 /tmp/log/sbrescue.log".  Make sure all other cmd lines are commented out!

4.  Run "./doit.sh" and wait.  You might want to redirect to a file if there are a lot.

Common errors:
- "Partitions found on hdX" - the burnin process halts if there are partitions detected.  Burnin should only be run on new servers with blank drives or recycled servers which have been zerofilled.  The existance of partitions means there is a chance a customer accidentally got sent through burnin.  If there are no orphan servers, it is safe to send these through zerofill, which will automatically do a burnin when it is done.

- "Unable to mount hdX for testing" - serious drive errors preventing the burnin script from being able to mount the drive for testing.  Need to get the drive in question replaced.

- "Benchmark failed on hdX" - burnin script found IDE?DMA errors in dmesg.  This normally indicates a failing drive, unless it is a Gigabyte motherboard.  Check the SMART log with "smartctl -l error /dev/hdX".  If there are IDE/DMA errors and no SMART errors, replace the motherboard.  If there are SMART errors, replace the drive.

- "memtest bombed" - caused by extreme memory issues which causes memtest to segfault.  Need to get DC Ops to test and replace RAM.  The server will automatically start burnin when it is reracked.

- "Memory Errors - ##" - memtest detected memory errors.  Need to get DC Ops to test and replace RAM.  The server will automatically start burnin when it is reracked.
