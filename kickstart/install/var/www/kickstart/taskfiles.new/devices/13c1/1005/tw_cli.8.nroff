\& tw_cli                 Interactive Mode

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fI\fItw_cli\fI\|(8)\fR is a Command Line Interface Storage Management Software for 
AMCC/3ware \s-1ATA\s0 \s-1RAID\s0 Controller(s). It provides controller, logical unit and drive
management. tw_cli can be used in both interactive and batch mode, providing
higher-level \s-1API\s0 (Application Programming Interface) functionalities.
.PP
The \s-1CLI\s0 prompt indicates the current object in focus, expressed in \s-1URI\s0 (Universal 
Resource Identifier) syntax consisting of a hostname (\fI//hostname\fR), and an object
path (\fI/path/path/object\fR) such as \fI//elvis/c0/u0\fR. User can set the focus to a
particular object by \fIfocus \s-1URI\s0\fR.  
.PP
\&\s-1CLI\s0 also supports \fIcomments\fR. Command lines beginning with \fI#\fR denotes start
of comment. This feature is mostly useful with batch processing via \fI\-f script\fR 
flag.
.PP
\&\s-1CLI\s0 uses the following terminology:
.PP
\&\fBLogical Units.\fR  Usually shortened to \*(L"units\*(R", these are block devices presented
to the operating system.  A logical unit can be a one\-tier, two\-tier, or three-tier
arrangement.  Spare and Single logical units are examples of one-tier units. 
\&\s-1RAID\-1\s0 and \s-1RAID\-5\s0 are examples of two-tier units and 
as such will have sub\-units. \s-1RAID\-10\s0 and \s-1RAID\-50\s0 are examples of three-tier units
and as such will have sub\-sub\-units.  
.PP
\&\fBPort.\fR  3ware controller models up to the 9650SE series have one or many ports
(typically 4, 8, 12, 16, or 24).  Each port can be attached to a single disk drive.
On a controller such as the 9650SE with a multilane serial port connector, one
connector supports four ports.  On 9690SA series controllers, connections are 
made with phys and vports (virtual ports).
.PP
\&\fBPhy.\fR  Phys are tranceivers that transmit and receive the serial data stream 
that flows between the controller and the drives.  The 9690SA controller 
have 8 phys.  These \*(L"controller phys\*(R" are associated with virtual ports (vports)
to establish up to 128 potential connections with the \s-1SAS\s0 or \s-1SATA\s0 drives.  Each 
controller phy can be connected to a single drive, or can be connected through
an expander to additional drives.
.PP
\&\fBVPort.\fR  Connections from the 9690SA controller to drives are referred to 
as \fIvirtual ports\fR, or vports.  A vport indicates the \s-1ID\s0 of a drive, whether
it is directly connected to the controller, or cascaded through one of more 
expanders.  The vport, in essense, is a handle in the software to uniquely 
identify a drive.  The port \s-1ID\s0 or vport \s-1ID\s0 allows a drive to be consistently
identified, used and managed in a \s-1RAID\s0 unit.  For dual-ported drives, although
there are two connections to a drive, the drive is still identified with one 
vport handle.  \fBNote:\fR With the controller summay via the command \*(L"show\*(R", 
the number of (V)Ports shown may contain two times (2X) the number of drives
(suggesting the dual-ported drive type) even though the (V)Port column of 
the summary to the command \*(L"/cx show\*(R" contains only the number of vports 
corresponding to the number of drives.  This is because the drive is 
identified with only one vport handle.
.PP
\&\fB\s-1NOTE:\s0\fR For all practical purposes, hereafter port and vport are used 
interchangeably in reference to a drive (or disk).  Therefore, unless otherwise 
specified, the mention of port implies vport as well.  That is, while \*(L"port\*(R" 
is mentioned to denote a drive, it is implied that for the applicable controller 
series, the reference also applies to vport.
.PP
\&\s-1CLI\s0 supports a set of primary command syntax and a set of legacy command syntax 
that is the old or original command syntax.  \fBNote:\fR The primary command syntax
replaces that legacy command syntax and as such support for legacy commands will 
discontinue in the near future.  
.PP
Please also note that some of the commands listed in this document are qualified 
with restrictions of controller type/model support.  For example, \*(L"9000 series\*(R" or
\&\*(L"9KSX/SE only\*(R" may be next to a command.  The following is a summary of the 
controller qualified specifications.
.PP
Commands with:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&  No specifications     Could be used across all controller platforms.  This includes 
\&                        the 7000 and 8000 series controllers.
\&  9000 series           Could be used in all controllers in the 9000 series.  This 
\&                        excludes the 7000 and 8000 series controllers, and includes
\&                        the 9550SX, 9590SE, 9650SE and 9690SA controllers.
\&  9KSX/SE only          Could be used in all controllers of the 9xxxSX or SE only.
\&  9KSX/SE/SA only       Could be used in all controllers of the 9xxxSX, SE or SA only.
.Ve
.PP
The above implies an ordering of the command set hierarchy, where \*(L"No specification\*(R" is 
the superset of \*(L"9000 series\*(R" that in turn is the superset of \*(L"9KSX/SE only\*(R". 
.PP
For the Mac system, while still true, the command qualifier is not meaningful
as all commmands are supported, provided the controller model is 9590SE or 9650SE 
(or above).
.PP
Here is a summary of the controllers and their associated support or features:
.PP
.Vb 16

.PP
Please note that the features are accumulative down the list, excepted where 
noted.  Also, \s-1CCU\s0 (Chassis Control Unit) refers to \s-1JMR\s0 enclosure/Sidecar.
.PP
This document organizes the \s-1CLI\s0 command set as different types of Object 
Messages, and descriptions and examples are presented for each object message 
or command.  While some of the system features could be invoked with one 
\&\*(L"set\*(R" command and correspondingly displayed with a \*(L"show\*(R" command and as such, 
information regarding the feature may be self-contained within the description 
of the set command, other features may require or involve a set of commands 
that work together and may not be so straight\-forward.  For these, the command 
descriptions may present a fragmented view of the feature as a result.  For 
an encapsulated view of certain features and their relevant command set, please see 
the \fBFeatures\fR section of this document.
.PP
This document, therefore,  may be used as a reference for individual commands 
and also as a reference for supported features.  For the former please see 
the \fBPrimary Command Syntax\fR sections, and for the latter please see the 
Features sections.
.SH "Primary Command Syntax"
.IX Header "Primary Command Syntax"
The primary command syntax will replace the legacy command syntax in the future 
releases.  The new and improved command format follows a general grammar in 
the form:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& Object Message Attributes
.Ve
.PP
Objects can be shell commands or can specify a controller, logical unit,
port or vport (drive), or battery backup unit (bbu).  Messages are commands 
sent to the requested objects.  It may be a read operation such as for the
command \*(L"show\*(R",  or a write operation for the set, delete, add, stop, start, 
or remove commands.  Attributes specify the values to read or write.  
Attributes are either \fIBoolean Attributes\fR or \fINamed Attributes\fR. Value of a Boolean
attribute is deduced by presence. Value of named attributes are
expressed in a \*(L"key = value\*(R" format. 
.Sh "Shell Object Messages"
.IX Subsection "Shell Object Messages"
Shell Object Messages are commands (a.k.a. methods/messages) that are sent to
the Command Interpreter (a.k.a. Shell/CLI) itself. 
.RE
.IP "\fIshow\fR"
.IX Item "show"
This command shows a general summary of all detected controllers.  Note that the
appropriate kernel device drivers should be loaded for the list to show all 
controllers. The intention is to provide a global view of the environment.
.PP
Typical output looks like:
.PP
.Vb 1

.Ve
.PP
The output indicates that \fIController 0\fR is a 7500 model with 12 Ports, with 8 Drives
detected (attached), total of 3 Units, with one unit in a NotOpt (Not Optimal) state,
a RRate(Rebuild Rate) of 2, VRate(Verify Rate) of '\-' (Not Applicable), \s-1BBU\s0 of '\-'
(Not Applicable).  Not Optimal refers to any state except \s-1OK\s0 and \s-1VERIFYING\s0.  Other
states include \s-1INITIALIZING\s0, \s-1INIT\-PAUSED\s0, \s-1REBUILDING\s0, \s-1REBUILD\-PAUSED\s0, \s-1DEGRADED\s0, 
\&\s-1MIGRATING\s0, \s-1MIGRATE\-PAUSED\s0, \s-1RECOVERY\s0, \s-1INOPERABLE\s0, and \s-1UNKNOWN\s0.
.PP
For a system with an enclosure unit as an attached expander, and the appropriate 
controller (9690SA), a global view of the environment includes summary 
information about detected enclosures.  As example:

Please refer to command \fI/cx update fw=filename_with_path [force]\fR for detail.
.RE
.IP "\fBfocus\fR \fIObject\fR"
.IX Item "focus Object"
This command will set the specified object in focus. This command is active in
interactive mode only and is provided to reduce typing.  Recall that messages (or
commands) are sent to objects such as 
.PP
.Vb 1
\& //hostname/c0/u0 show
.Ve
.PP
Instead, if the focus is set to \fI//hostname/c0/u0\fR, the prompt is changed 
automatically to reflect this and the user would only have to type \fIshow\fR.
The concept is similar to being in a particular location in a file system and
requesting a listing of the current directory.
.PP
\&\fIobject\fR can have the following forms:
.PP
\&\fI//hostname/cx/ux\fR specifies the fully qualified \s-1URI\s0 of an object on host 
\&\fBhostname\fR, controller \fBcx\fR, unit \fBux\fR.
.PP
\&\fI//hostname\fR specifies root of host \fBhostname\fR.  The hostname is the name of 
the system where your 3ware \s-1RAID\s0 controllers are.  With current releases, the 
hostname here should be always your system's name.
.PP
\&\fI..\fR specifies one level up (the parent object).
.PP
\&\fI/\fR specifies the root at the current focused host.
.PP
\&\fI./obj\fR specifies the next level of the object.
.PP
\&\fI/c0/bbu\fR specifies a relative path with respect to the current focused hostname.
.PP
For example:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& //localhost> focus //elvis.amcc.com
\& //elvis.amcc.com>

.Sh "Controller Object Messages"
.IX Subsection "Controller Object Messages"
Controller Object Messages are commands (a.k.a. methods/messages) that are sent to
an instance of a controller such as \fI/c0\fR. 
.RE
.IP "\fI/cx\fR \fBshow\fR"
.IX Item "/cx show"
This command shows summary information on the specified controller \fI/cx\fR. This report
consists of two to three parts; a \fBUnit\fR summary listing all present units, 
a \fBPort\fR summary section listing of all present disks and their attached ports, and
a \fB\s-1BBU\s0\fR summary section listing if a \s-1BBU\s0 unit is installed on the controller.
.PP
The \fBUnit\fR summary section lists all present units specifying their Unit Number,
Unit type (such \s-1RAID\s0 5), the unit status (such as \s-1OK\s0, \s-1VERIFYING\s0, \s-1INITIALIZING\s0, etc.),
the \fB%RCompl\fR which reports percent completion, the \fB%V/I/M\fR which reports the percent
completion of Verify, Initialize, or Migrating status of the unit, the stripe size, the
usable capacity in Giga (or Tera) Bytes, the write cache state setting, and the 
autoverify setting.
.PP
Note:  If a \*(L"*\*(R" appears at the end of the status, it means one of its sub-unit is in
\&\s-1WARNING\s0 state which a recoverable error might be found in the corresponding port.
.PP
For controller models up to the 9650SE series, the \fBPort\fR summary section lists 
all present ports specifying the port number, disk status, unit affiliation, 
size (in human readable and blocks of 512 bytes), and disk vendor assigned 
serial number.
.PP
For the 9690SA controller series, this section lists virtual ports specifying
the \fBVPort\fR number, disk status, unit affiliation, drive type, phy number (if
direct attached), the enclosure and slot (if expander attached), and model
number of the drive.  
.PP
The \fB\s-1BBU\s0\fR summary section lists a few important attributes such as hours left 
(in which the current \s-1BBU\s0 can backup the controller cache in the event of power
loss), temperature, voltage, and its readiness, etc.
.PP
Additional attributes about controllers, units, ports and disks can be obtained
by querying for them explicitly. See other show sub-commands below.

This command shows the Auto-Carving policy.  If the policy is on, all
newly created or migrated units larger than carvesize will be automatically 
carved into multiples of carvesize volumes and 1 remainder volume.  
Each volume can be treated as an individual disk with its own file system.  
The default carvesize is 2 \s-1TB\s0.  
.PP
This feature is useful for operating systems limited to 2 \s-1TB\s0 filesystems.  
For 64\-bit \s-1OS\s0 users, there is no need to set the policy to be \*(L"on\*(R" 
unless users want to have multiple smaller volumes to the \s-1OS\s0.  
For 32\-bit \s-1OS\s0 users, it is recommended to keep the policy on unless users 
know their \s-1OS\s0 supports more than 2 \s-1TB\s0 disk devices.
.PP
When autocarve policy is off, all the new unit creation consists of one 
single volume.

reasons.  However, if there is no \s-1BBU\s0 available for the controller, a warning 
is sent to standard error.
2) The default drive queuing policy is enabled, unless it is specifically set
to disable queuing by specifing \fInoqpolicy\fR.
3) The \fInoqpolicy\fR attribute is not applicable to the \*(L"spare\*(R" unit.  Specifying 
the noqpolicy attribute returns an error.

.PP
\&\fBgroup=3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|11|12|13|14|15|16\fR consists of the number of disks per group 
for a Raid 50 type.  \fBNote:\fR This attribute can only be used when type=raid50. Also,
group=13\-16 is applicable to 9690SA only.
.PP
Recall that a \s-1RAID\-50\s0 is a multi-tier array. At the most bottom layer,
N number of disks per group are used to form the \s-1RAID\-5\s0 layer. These
\&\s-1RAID\-5\s0 arrays are then integrated into a \s-1RAID\-0\s0. This attribute allows
you to specify the number of disks in the \s-1RAID\-5\s0 level. Valid values
are 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8.
.PP
Note that a sufficient number of disks are required for a given pattern or
disk group. For example, given 6 disks, specifying 3 will create two \s-1RAID\-5\s0.
However given 12 disks, specifying 3 will create four \s-1RAID\-5\s0 under the \s-1RAID\-0\s0 
level.  Given 6 disks and grouping of 6 is not allowed, as you'll basically 
be creating a \s-1RAID\-5\s0.
.PP
The default group varies based on number of disks. For 6 & 9 disks, default 
is group=3.  For 8 disks, default is group=4. For 10 or 15 disks, default is 
group=5.  For 12 or 16 disks, default is group=4.  For 14 disks, default is 
group=7.  Case of 12 disks could be grouped with group=3, group=4, or group=6. 
Group=4 was set by default as it provides best net capacity and performance.  
Case of 15 disks could be grouped with group=3 or group=5.  And case 
of 16 disks could be grouped with group=4 and group=8.  
.PP
Note that the supported group number indicated depends on the number of ports
on the controller.  group=16 is the maximum and it is available on the 9690SA. 
.PP
\&\fBnoscan\fR attribute instructs \s-1CLI\s0 not to notify \s-1OS\s0 of creation of the new unit.
By default \s-1CLI\s0 will inform the \s-1OS\s0. One application of this feature is to avoid 
the \s-1OS\s0 from creating block special devices such as /dev/sdb and /dev/sdc as some 
implementations might create naming fragmentation and creating a moving target.
.PP
\&\fBnocache\fR attribute instructs \s-1CLI\s0 disable the write cache on the newly created unit.
Enabling write cache increases performance at the cost of high\-availability.  No
cache is recommended when no \s-1BBU\s0 or \s-1UPS\s0 is installed.
.PP
\&\fBautoverify\fR attribute enables the autoverify attribute on the unit that is to
be created. For more details on this feature, refer to \*(L"cx/ux set Commands\*(R" section of
this document. This feature is not supported on model 7000/8000. On model 9000,
\&\s-1JBOD\s0 autoverify attribute is not persistent (does not survive reboots).
.PP
\&\fBnoqpolicy\fR attribute instructs \s-1CLI\s0 to disable the qpolicy (drive queuing) on the 
newly created unit.  The default qpolicy is \fIon\fR (i.e., noqpolicy is not specified).
For the spare unit, drive queueing is not meaningful and the qpolicy cannot 
be set.  During unit creation, specifying \fInoqpolicy\fR for spare returns an error.
.PP
\&\fBignoreECC\fR attribute enables the ignoreECC/OverwriteECC attribute on the unit that is to
be created. For more details on this feature, refer to \*(L"cx/ux set Commands\*(R" section of
this document. The following table illustrates the supported Model-Unit Type.
This table only applies to setting this feature at unit creation time.
Generally ignoreECC applies to redundant units.

\&\fBname=string\fR attribute allows user to name the new unit.  The maximum characters 
allowed for the string are 21.  No space is allowed within the string.  If user likes
to use some special characters which the \s-1OS\s0 command shell reserves such as '<', '>',
\&'!', and '&', etc in the name string, the user has to use quote "" around the name
string in order to bypass the command shell.  User can change the name of the unit 
any time after the unit creation.  This is a feature for 9000 or above series of
controllers.  Please refer to commands \fI/cx/ux set name=sting\fR for changing the 
name and \fI/cx/ux show name\fR for checking.
.PP
\&\fBstorsave=protect|balance|perform\fR attribute allows user to set the storsave policy
of the new unit. It is a 9KSX/SE only feature.  Please refer to command 
\&\fI/cx/ux set storsave=protect|balance|perform\fR for detail.
.PP
Either the \fBv0=n\fR or \fBvol=a:b:c:d\fR attribute may be used to set the size of the 
first volume or (up to) the first 4 volumes of the new unit, respectively.  The 
first volume may, but not necessarily, be the boot \s-1LUN\s0.  The value(s) should be
positive integer(s) in units of gigabytes (\s-1GB\s0).  Zero (0) is an invalid \s-1LUN\s0 
size input value.  The upper user input limit is 32TB.  However, if the input size 
exceeds the size of the array, the volume would be left \*(L"uncarved\*(R".  Note that there 
are two ways to set the first volume, as either v0=n or vol=n would have the same 
effect. 
.PP
Example (\s-1RAID\-5\s0 being created with the first volume size set to 10 \s-1GB\s0):

The attribute \fBrapidrecovery\fR specifies the Rapid \s-1RAID\s0 Recovery setting for
the unit to be created.  Rapid \s-1RAID\s0 Recovery can speed up the rebuild 
process, and it can speed up the initialize and verify tasks for redundant 
arrays in the \s-1RAID\s0 system upon the event of an unclean system shutdown.  
This feature allows for expedited boot-up time in the event of an unclean 
shutdown.  Setting this option to \fIall\fR applies the policy to the rebuild,
initialize and verify tasks at reboot.  Setting it to \fIrebuild\fR applies the 
policy to the rebuild tasks only.  If the policy is set to \fIdisable\fR, then 
none of the tasks would be sped up.
.PP
\&\fBNote:\fR Once this attribute is set, the policy setting is persistent in the 
system until it is disabled.  Also, once disabled, that setting could not be 
changed for that unit at a later time.

This command instructs the controller to rescan all ports and reconstitute
all units. The controller will update its list of ports (attached disks), and visits
every \s-1DCB\s0 (Disk Configuration Block) in order to re-assemble its view and
awareness of logical units.  Any newly found unit(s) or drive(s) will be listed.
\&\fInoscan\fR is used to not inform the \s-1OS\s0 of the unit discovery. Default is to inform

.IP "\fI/cx\fR \fBcommit\fR"
.IX Item "/cx commit"
This command instructs the controller to commit its dirty DCBs to
persistent storage (ie disks). While controller is processing I/O requests
against underlying disks, an in-transaction bit is set. If a failure (such
as power failure) is experienced, subsequent read from the disks, will inform
the controller that an un-clean shutdown took place. This command allows the
end user to complete all pending I/Os on disks and clear the in-transaction
bit.
.PP
Typical application of this feature is when an application is using a given
unit in raw mode (such as databases) and user would like to shutdown the
host (Including \s-1UPS\s0 post failure automations). This command can then expedite
the process by instructing the controller to finish pending requests, clear
\&\s-1DCB\s0's in-transaction flag as we are going down.

Note that block devices (cooked devices) do not require this and clients of
block devices (such as file systems) will send its own shutdown request to the 
devices.

Asynchronous events are originated by firmware and captured by their respective device

user space programs such as \s-1CLI\s0 and/or 3DMPlus. These events reflect warning, debugging
and/or informative messages for the end user.

Alarms generated on the 7000/8000 series controllers do not have dates, as such 
a dash ('\-') indicating 'read not\-applicable' is displayed in the \*(L"Date\*(R" column. Also,
with the 7000/8000 series controllers, the alarm message contains the severity as well, 
hence the \*(L"Severity\*(R" column shows a '\-' also.

Verify is one of the supported background tasks, and show verify shows you the 
current verify schedule.
.PP
For 9650SE and 9690SA \s-1RAID\s0 controllers, the Verify Task Schedule can be either 
\&\fBbasic\fR or \fBadvanced\fR (For details about the two types and the associated
commands, please see the 'Features' section.)  The basic Verify Task Schedule 
sets a weekly day and time for verification to occur, and is designed to be 
used with auto-verification of units. The advanced Verify Task Schedule provides 
more control, and is equivalent to the Verify Task Schedule available for 
9550SX and earlier \s-1RAID\s0 controllers.
.PP
For the advanced Verify Task Schedule, up to 7 time periods can be registered, 
known as timeslots (or simply slots) 1 through 7. This task schedule can be 
managed by a set of commands including add, del, show and set a task. The task 
schedule has a slot id, start\-day\-time, duration, and status attributes. Rebuilds, 
migrations, and initializations follow similar background task schedules.
.PP
For details about setting up a schedule for verify tasks, see \fI/cx set verify\fR.
.PP
Verify activity attempts to verify all units based on their unit type.  Verifying
\&\s-1RAID\-1\s0 involves checking that both drives contain the exact data.  On \s-1RAID\-5\s0, the 
parity information is used to verify data integrity. \s-1RAID\-10\s0 and 50 are composite 
types and follow their respective array types. On the 9000 series, non-redundant units
such as \s-1RAID\-0\s0, \s-1JBOD\s0, single, and spare, are also verified (by reading and reporting
un-readable sectors).
.PP
Example 1:
For 9550SX and earlier controllers, and when verify=advanced for 9650SE and 9690SA 
controllers, the show verify command displays the current verify background task 
schedule as illustrated below.

Model 9000 series support background tasks such as rebuild, verify, or self test

7 tasks can be registered, known as slots 1 through 7. Each activity can be managed
by a set of commands including \fBadd\fR, \fBdel\fR, \fBshow\fR and \fBset\fR a task. Background
tasks have a slot id, start\-day\-time, duration, status attributes.
.PP
\&\fBselftest\fR activity provides two types of selftests; \s-1UDMA\s0 (Ultra Direct Memory Access)
and \s-1SMART\s0 (Self Monitoring Analysis and Reporting).  Both self tests are checked once
each day by default.
.PP
\&\s-1UDMA\s0 self test entails checking the current parallel \s-1ATA\s0 bus speed (between controller and 
attached disk), which could have been throttled down during previous operations, and 
increases the speed for best performance (usually one level higher). Possible speeds 
include 33, 66, 100 and 133 Mhz.  Note that the \s-1UDMA\s0 selftest is not 
applicable (or required) with \s-1SATA\s0 drives, but is left enabled by default.
.PP
\&\s-1SMART\s0 selftest instructs the controller to check certain \s-1SMART\s0 supported thresholds
by the disk vendor.  An \s-1AEN\s0 is logged to the alarms page if a drive reports a \s-1SMART\s0
failure.  The failing drive should be replaced if this error occurs.

This command only applies to 9650SE and the 9690SA \s-1RAID\s0 controllers.
.PP
Using the verify=basic option allows you to set a basic verify schedule 
that starts each week at the same date and time. With verify=basic, you 
can specify your preferred day and time, or you can omit the day and time 
and use the default of Friday at midnight.
.PP
When you set verify=basic, the series of scheduled days and times 
associated with the advanced Verify Task Schedule is ignored.
.PP
Verify=basic is intended to be used with the auto-verify policy for \s-1RAID\s0 
units, to insure that a verification of the unit occurs on a regular 
basis.  Also, for this reason, in systems that support Basic Verify, 
auto-verify is set to \s-1ON\s0 by default.
.PP
Note: When verify=basic, if you start a manual verify, it will start 
immediately. When verify=advanced, if you start a manual verify, it will 
follow the advanced Verify Task Schedule.  For more information, see

This command allows you to set a controller based cache policy. If the policy
is set to \fIcacheoff\fR, then if a unit is degraded, firmware will disable
the write-cache on the degraded unit, regardless of what the unit-based policy
is. If the policy is set to \fIfollow\fR, then if a unit is degraded, firmware will

This command allows you to set a controller based disk spin up policy. The value
must be a positive integer between 1 to the number of disks/ports supported on
the controller (e.g. 4, 8, 12, 16). This policy is used to stagger spin ups of disks
at boot time in order to spread the power consumption on the power supply.
For example, given a spin up policy of 2, the controller will spin up two disks
at a time, pause, and then spin up another 2 disks, etc, etc. The amount of time
to pause can be specified with the spin up stagger time policy.

.IP "\fI/cx\fR \fBset\fR \fIautocarve=on|off\fR  (9KSX/SE/SA only)"
.IX Item "/cx set autocarve=on|off  (9KSX/SE/SA only)"
This command allows you to set the Auto-Carving policy to be on or off.  
When the Auto-Carving policy is on, any unit larger than the carvesize 
is created or migrated into one or more carvesize volumes and a remaining 
volume.  Each volume can be treated as an individual disk with its own 
file system.  The default carvesize is 2 \s-1TB\s0.  This feature is useful for 
operating systems limited to 2 \s-1TB\s0 filesystems.  
.PP
For example a 3 \s-1TB\s0 array would be configured into a 2 \s-1TB\s0 and a 1 \s-1TB\s0 
volumes with default carvesize.  For a 5 \s-1TB\s0 array, two 2 \s-1TB\s0 volumes 
would be created plus a 1 \s-1TB\s0 volume.  
.PP
When autocarve policy is off, all the new unit creation or migration 
consists of one single volume.

This command sets Auto-Rebuild policy to be on or off.  If the policy 
is on, the firmware will choose drives in the following priority order for 
a candidate of a rebuild operation (on a degraded unit).
.PP
1.  Smallest usable capacity spare.

.IX Item "/cx set autodetect=on|off disk=<p:-p>|all     (9000 series)"
This command is associated with the stagger spin-up feature during hot\-plug.
With stagger spin-up enabled (see command \fB/cx set spinup\fR and \fB/cx set stagger\fR),
during reset or power on, the controller will try to detect all drives that are 
present and spin them up staggered in time, allowing the spread of power consumption 
on the power supply.  Upon drive hot\-plug, that is, \fBnot\fR on power-on or reset, the 
default behavior of the system is automatic detection of the drives and immediate 
spin\-up.  This command would change the default behavior and set the controller 
to spin-up as the system at power\-on.
.PP
\&\fBautodetect=on|off\fR attribute configures the controller drive auto-detect setting.
It should be set to \fIoff\fR to initiate the sequence for the stagger spin-up during
hot-plug process.  After the drives are inserted or re-inserted to the ports (as
specified in the second attribute decribed below), it should be set back to \fIon\fR
to complete the configuration process for the controller to initiate the drive
spin\-up.
.PP
\&\fBdisk=\fR\fB<p:\-p\fR>\fB|all\fR attribute specifies one or many disks (i.e., drives or ports).  
If a port is empty (i.e., no drive inserted), the echo message of the command 
refers to a port, and if there is already a drive inserted the message refers 
to a disk.  The example below shows that auto detect has been set to \fIoff\fR to
initiate stagger spin-up during hot\-plug, where \fIport 3\fR was empty and \fIports 5\fR 
and \fI6\fR had drives inserted. 
.PP
.Vb 2
\& //localhost>> /c0 set autodetect=off disk=3:5-6
\& Setting Auto-Detect on /c0 to [off] for port [3] and for disk [5,6]... Done
.Ve
.PP
If \*(L"disk=all\*(R", then all of the drives or ports for that controller are specified.
for example:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& //localhost>> /c0 set autodetect=off disk=all
\& Setting Auto-Detect on /c2 to [off] for all disks/ports... Done.
.Ve
.PP
To illustrate how the command is used, here is a usage scenario:
.PP
.Vb 6
\& 1. Issue command (set autodetect=off) to disable automatic detection of the 
\&    ports for staggered spin-up.
\& 2. Pull out the drives of the specified ports (if not empty).
\& 3. Replace the drives previously removed at the ports specified.
\& 4. Issue command (set autodetect=on) to enable auto detect of the ports with
\&    the newly inserted drives.
.Ve
.PP
The above procedure would spin-up the newly inserted drives in a staggered manner.
Please note that the command takes longer to complete for ports that do not have 
drives inserted.

This feature is only available with 9000 series of controllers.
.PP
This command allows you to migrate an existing unit (aka source) to a unit with 
\&\fItype=RaidType\fR (aka destination), to increase capacity, change the \s-1RAID\s0 level (with
the same or increased capacity), or change the stripe size.
.PP
The unit that results from the migration (destination unit) is subject to similar 
rules and policies that apply when creating a new unit.  For example, a valid number 
of disks and parameters must be specified.  The destination unit must use all source 
disks and potentially augment the number of disks in the \fBdisk=\f(BIp:\-p\fB\fR disk list.  
Unspecified parameters are assigned default values (stripe size of 64K, write 
cache enabled, autoverify disabled, and ignoreECC disabled).  
.PP
The unit to be migrated (source unit) must be in a normal state (not degraded, 
initializing, or rebuilding) before the migration.  If the source unit is of type 
\&\s-1RAID\-1\s0 and the destination unit is of type single, the disk-specifier of the 
migration command [disk=\fIp:\-p\fR] is actually not optional and must \fBnot\fR be included 
in the command.  The drives in the \s-1RAID\-1\s0 array would become multiple units of type 
single after the migration, and the source drives are the destination drives.  
Specifying more drives with the \*(L"disk=\*(R" option would return an error.
.PP
Both source unit name and serial number will be carried over to the destination 
unit.  However, the \s-1RAID\-1\s0 to single migration path is a special case.  In this case, 
the \fBmigrate\fR command splits both drives into two identical single disks.  The 
source unit name will be duplicated on the destination units, or single disks,  
but the source unit serial number will \fBnot\fR be carried over to new unit.  The 
new destination unit will have its own serial number.  
.PP
\&\fBtype=RaidType\fR consists of the destination unit \s-1RAID\s0 type as in \fBraid0\fR, \fBraid1\fR, 
\&\fBraid5\fR, \fBraid10\fR, \fBraid50\fR, \fBraid6\fR, or \fBsingle\fR.  
.PP
For example \*(L"type=raid5\*(R" indicates the destination unit is \s-1RAID\-5\s0.

\&\fINote:\fR  You can only migrate a unit to a \s-1RAID\s0 level that has the same or larger
capacity as the exisiting one.  A four-drive \s-1RAID\-5\s0 unit can migrate to a four-drive
\&\s-1RAID\-0\s0, but a four-drive \s-1RAID\-0\s0 unit cannot migrate to a four-drive \s-1RAID\-5\s0, without
adding another drive, due to the need for additional storage capacity for parity bits.
.PP
\&\fBdisk=p:\-p\fR consists of a list of ports or vports (disks) to be used in addition 
to the source disks in the construction of the destination unit. One or more ports 
can be specified. Multiple ports can be specified using \fB\*(L":\*(R"\fR or \fB\*(L"\-\*(R"\fR as port 
index separators.  A dash indicates a range and can be mixed with \*(L":\*(R". For example
\&\fBdisk=0:1:2\-5:9:12\fR indicates port 0, 1, 2 thru 5 (inclusive), 9 and 12.
.PP
\&\fBgroup=3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|11|12|13|14|15|16\fR is \fBonly\fR applicable to \fBtype=raid50\fR 
which consists of a number of disks per group.  Recall that a \s-1RAID\-50\s0 is a multi-tier 
array. At the most bottom layer, N number of disks per group are used to form the 
\&\s-1RAID\-5\s0 layer.  These \s-1RAID\-5\s0 arrays are then integrated into a \s-1RAID\-0\s0. This option 
allows you to specify the number of disks in the \s-1RAID\-5\s0 level. Valid values are 3, 
4, 5 and 6.  For example \fBgroup=3\fR indicates 3 disks of \s-1RAID\-5\s0 at the bottom layer
of \s-1RAID\-50\s0.
.PP
\&\fINote:\fR You can have a maximum of 4 subunits in a \s-1RAID\-50\s0 unit.
.PP
Note that a sufficient number of disks are required for a given pattern or disk
group. For example, given 6 disks, specifying 3 will create two \s-1RAID\-5\s0.  However
given 12 disks, specifying 3 will create four \s-1RAID\-5\s0 under the \s-1RAID\-0\s0 level.  Given
6 disks and grouping of 6 is not allowed, as you'll basically be creating a \s-1RAID\-5\s0.
.PP
The default disk \fBgroup\fR varies based on number of disks. For 6 & 9 disks, default
is group=3.  For 8 disks, default is group=4. For 10 or 15 disks, default is
group=5.  For 12 or 16 disks, default is group=4.  For 14 disks, default is
group=7.  Case of 12 disks could be grouped with group=3, group=4, or group=6.
Group=4 was set by default as it provides best net capacity and performance.
Case of 15 disks could be grouped with group=3 or group=5.  And case
of 16 disks could be grouped with group=4 and group=8.
.PP
Note that \s-1RAID\-10\s0 always has \fBgroup=2\fR, so an attribute specifying its group is 
not necessary.
.PP
\&\fBStripe\fR consists of the logical unit stripe size to be used.  The following table 
illustrates the supported and applicable stripes on the respective unit types and 
controller models. Stripe size units are in \s-1KB\s0 (kilobytes).

\&\fBnoscan\fR instructs \s-1CLI\s0 not to notify the operating system (\s-1OS\s0) of the 
creation of the new unit.  By default \s-1CLI\s0 will inform the \s-1OS\s0. One application 
of this feature is to prevent the \s-1OS\s0 from creating block special devices such 
as /dev/sdb and /dev/sdc as some implementations might create naming fragmentation 
and a moving target.
.PP
\&\fBnocache\fR instructs \s-1CLI\s0 to disable the write cache on the migrated 
unit.  Enabling write cache increases performance, but at the cost of potential
data loss in the event of sudden power loss (unless a \s-1BBU\s0 or \s-1UPS\s0 is installed).
By default the cache is enabled.  Unless there is a \s-1BBU\s0 or \s-1UPS\s0 installed, to 
avoid the possibility of data loss in the event of sudden power loss, it is 
recommended that \fBnocache\fR be specified.
.PP
\&\fBautoverify\fR enables the autoverify attribute on the unit to be 
migrated. For more details on this feature, refer to \*(L"cx/ux set autoverify\*(R"
section of this document.
.PP
\&\fB\f(BIMigration Process.\fB\fR  In all cases of migration, the background migration process
must be completed before the newly sized unit is available for use.  You can continue
using the original unit during this time.  Once the migration is finished, a reboot 
will be required if you are booted from the unit.  For secondary storage, depending 
on your operating system, you may need to first unmount the unit, then use \s-1CLI\s0 to 
\&'remove' and 'rescan' the unit so that the operating system can see the new capacity,
and then remount the unit.
.PP
You may also need to resize the file system or add a new partition.  For instructions, 
consult the documentation for your operating system.
.PP
\&\fINote\fR:  It is important that you allow migration to complete before adding drives
to the unit or move it to another controller.  Making any physical changes to the 
unit during migration may cause the migration to stop, and can jeopardize the safety
of your data.  
.PP
\&\fB\f(BIExamples.\fB\fR  The two examples which follow show the usage of this command for
splitting a mirror and for capacity expansion, respectively.  Following those are
sample outputs of the migrate function.  After which example outputs showing the
special case are presented.
.PP
Example of split mirror:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& //localhost> /c1/u3 migrate type=single
\& Sending migration message to /c1/u3 ... Done.
.Ve
.PP
The source unit u3 is a \s-1TWINSTOR\s0 or \s-1RAID\-1\s0, using the \fBmigrate\fR command splits u3 to u3 
and u\fIx\fR, each with the \s-1RAID\s0 type of Single.
.PP
Example of capacity expansion:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& //localhost> /c0/u3 migrate type=raid10 disk=10-11 stripe=16
\& Sending migration message to /c0/u3 ... Done.
.Ve
.PP
The source unit is u3 and the destination unit is \s-1RAID\-10\s0 with disks 10 and 11 in 
addition to the disks in the existing unit u3.
.PP
The following is an example of how migrating units are displayed.  In this example, 
the set of reports indicate that /c0/u3 is a migrating unit with 39% completion.  The
\&\*(L"/c0/u3 show\*(R" command shows that the source unit is \fIsu3\fR and is of type \s-1RAID\-1\s0, and
the destination unit \fIdu3\fR is of type \s-1RAID\-10\s0.

Please note that the migration path of raidtype Single to \s-1RAID\-1\s0 is a special 
case.  Since the single unit would become a mirrored array, technically this 
is not a migration.  As a result this command shows a different status than
other migration paths.  In addition, the status of the newly specified disk 
would show \s-1DEGRADED\s0 until the \*(L"migration\*(R" is complete.   
.PP
For example, below is a system with two migrating units, /c0/u0 and /c0/u1.  
u0 is migrating from a \s-1RAID\-10\s0 to a \s-1RAID\-0\s0 array, while u1 is migrating from 
Single to a \s-1RAID\-1\s0, initiated by the following commands:
.PP

\& /c0/u0 migrate type=raid0
.Ve
.PP
and 
.PP
.Vb 1
\& /c0/u1 migrate type=raid1 disk=5

.IP "\fI/cx/px\fR \fBremove\fR [\fInoscan\fR] [\fIquiet\fR]"
.IX Item "/cx/px remove [noscan] [quiet]"
This command allows you to remove (or export) a port \fB/cx/px\fR (or drive). 
Exporting a port will instruct the firmware to remove the specified port
form its pool of managed ports, but retains the \s-1DCB\s0 (Disk Configuration Block)
meta-data on the attached disk.  You can import (or re\-introduce) the port
via \fBrescan\fR. \fInoscan\fR is used to not inform the \s-1OS\s0 of this change.
Default is to inform the \s-1OS\s0.  The quiet option is for non-interactive mode.
.PP
Use caution when using this command.  Drives, which are part of a redundant
array, can be removed,  but the array will be degraded.  Non-redundant drives, 
which are part of a unit, can not be removed.

The optional 'type' in the command specifies which statistics would be cleared. 
The options are either: \fBra\fR for Running Average, \fBlct\fR for Long Command Times,

Please note that if type=ra, both the Running Average and Histogram data are
cleared.  If type=lct, only the Long Command Times data would be cleared.  
And if type=ext, the extended drive statistics are cleared.  If no type is
specified, the default is the same as type=ra.

This command starts the battery capacity test.  The test may take up to 24 hours
to complete.  During the test, the \s-1BBU\s0 is \fBnot\fR capable of backup operation
and the write cache is disabled.  The performance of all the units under the
controller may be impacted because their write IOs are not cached.  Once the test 
is completed with no error and the \s-1BBU\s0 returns back to \s-1OK\s0 state, the write cache
will be resumed.  The quiet option is for non-interactive mode.
.PP
Check with the alarms command, \s-1AEN\s0 (Asynchronous Event Notification) messages are
also generated by controllers to notify user the status of the command.

The test cannot be terminated before it completes.

This command enables the \s-1BBU\s0 detection on the controller.  And the controller will utilize \s-1BBU\s0

.RE

.IX Item "/cx/bbu disable [quiet]"
This command disables the \s-1BBU\s0 detection on the controller.  In this situation, the controller 
ignores the existence of the \s-1BBU\s0 when the \s-1BBU\s0 detection is disabled.  In another words, when 
a \s-1BBU\s0 attaches to a controller and the \s-1BBU\s0 detection is disabled, the storage management 
software will show user that there is no \s-1BBU\s0 installed on this controller.  This is because 
the \s-1BBU\s0 detection is disabled.  The quiet option is for non-interactive mode.
.Sh "Enclosure Object Messages"
.IX Subsection "Enclosure Object Messages"
Enclosure Object Messages are commands (a.k.a. methods/messages) that are sent to an
instance of an enclosure such as e0.  The enclosure element object messages are commands
sent to an instance of the enclosure element such as fan0.  The subsections which follow
describe the commands of the enclosure and the enclosure elements.  The latter includes 
commands for the slot, fan, temperature sensor, and power supply elements.
.PP
\&\fBNote:\fR For the 9650SE controller, the enclosure support is CCU-based with SAF-TE 
(\s-1SCSI\s0 Accessed Fault-Tolerant Enclosure) protocol support.  In this configuration, 
the enclosure name or \s-1ID\s0 is 'ex' or '/e0'.  For the 9690SA controller with \s-1SES\-2\s0 
(\s-1SCSI\s0 Enclosure Services\-2) protocol support, the enclosure name is prepended by the 
controller name or \s-1ID\s0 as in '/cx/ex', or, '/c1/e0' for example.  
.PP
The command descriptions of this section show the syntax of enclosure commands for 
the 9690SA controller (and \s-1SES\-2\s0).  For the 9650SE and \s-1CCU\s0 enclosure, simply 
drop the prepended controller name in the command, as, not '/c1/e0' but '/e0'.  Also, 
for the 9650SE/CCU, the enclosure element power supply is not supported.

\&\fBNote:\fR Help stops at this /Object/Command level.  Help does not extend to the
Attribute level, and thus inquiry for /Object/Command/Attribute is not valid.

error message.

An alternate way to use Help is with '?' or 'help' at the end of a command 
string.  That is, starting with the object, followed by the command, followed by '?' or 
\&'help'.  For example, '/c0' being our object and 'show' is our command:

.SH "Features"
.IX Header "Features"
This section lists some of the features that \s-1CLI\s0 supports for the 3ware \s-1RAID\s0
product.  As mentioned previously, while some of the system features require using 
only a few commands, other features may require or involve a set of commands that 
work together.  Also, some of these feature may be compenhensively more complex 
to described as a few commands.  The purpose of this section is to provide an 
encapsulated view of these features.
.PP
Please note that you could consult the User Guide for more in-depth conceptual
information about features that can be used to control your 3ware \s-1RAID\s0 controller
as well.

The commands within the subsections below also appear in the \fBPrimary Command
Syntax\fR section of this document.  While some commands contain similar or 
identical information or examples, others may not.  Those that do not is likely
due to context, legacy, or other factors.  In any case, the explanations should 
be consistent across the two sections.
.Sh "Drive Performance Monitor"
.IX Subsection "Drive Performance Monitor"
Performance monitoring and statistics of the \s-1RAID\s0 controller, as a basis 
for analysis of performance, may also provide information for qualification 
and diagnostics. The Drive Performance Monitor of \s-1CLI\s0 supports statistics of
queue depths, IOPs, transfer rate, response time for reads/writes, and 
command reads/writes. 
.Sp
Queue depth refers to the number of reads/writes currently outstanding, 
IOPs refers to the number of reads/writes completing, transfer rate refers 
to the number of sectors read/written, response time refers to the 
execution time of all commands, and command read/writes refers to the 
drive and drive sectors' accumlated read and write commands.
.Sp
The types of drive performance statistics supported are organized into five 
groups:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\& - instantaneous
\& - running average
\& - long command times
\& - response histogram
\& - extended drive statistics
.Ve
.Sp
The instantaneous measurements provide a short duration average. The running 
average is a measure of long-term averages that smooth out the data, and 
results in older results fading from the average over time. The long command 
times is a collection of the commands with the longest read/write 
response time.  The response histogram categorizes the read/write execution 
times and group them together based on time frames. Finally, the extended
drive statistics refers to statistics of a drive's read commands, write 
commands, write commands with \s-1FUA\s0 (Force Unit Access), flush commands, and 
a drive sectors's read, write, and write commands with \s-1FUA\s0.
.Sp
\&\fBNote:\fR This feature is for the 9550SX, 9650SE, and 9690SA controllers, with 
exception of the commands related to extended drive statistics, that are 
supported on the 9650SE and 9690SA controllers only.
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1OPERATION\s0\fR
.Sp
The command syntax falls into three categories: 1) Configuration, 2) port-based 
drive statistics, and 3) controller-based drive statistics summary. The 
configuration category allows the user to see the settings as well as change them. 
At this time, the only setting that the user can change is 'enable' or 'disable'
of the Drive Performance Monitor. The port-based 'show' commands provide 
requested statistics based on type. The port-based 'set' command clears the 
specified type statistics. While these commands require the specification of 
the port each time, the controller-based commands do not and provide the 
information in a summary format.
.Sp
\&\fBNote:\fR Please note that the keyword 'pmstat' and 'dpmstat' generate the same 
system response.  At this time both could be used for Drive Performance Monitor
statistics.  In the future if other types of performance monitor support would
be added, 'pmstat' would denote Performance Monitor while 'dpmstat' would 
refer to Drive performance statistics only.
.Sp
The following table summarizes the drive performance monitor commands. The command 
type, command syntax, and corresponding descriptions are listed. Following the 
table is an important note, which is then followed by examples and usage of the 
commands.

\&\fBNote:\fR The command '/cx show dpmstat' shows the performance monitor 
configuration and the default set of summary statistics (type=inst) shows data 
(assuming I/O to the drives) regardless of whether the performance monitor setting is \s-1ON\s0 
or \s-1OFF\s0. If the setting is \s-1ON\s0 and I/O is running, the statistics data will show 
accordingly. These numbers will change over time because the measurements 
are being averaged. If the setting is \s-1OFF\s0, the same table layout is shown. However, 
since no more calculations are taking place, the data will be static and remains 
unchanged. Thus, when the drive performance monitor is \s-1OFF\s0, the statistics data 
shown may not be zeros.

Examples of the command's usage are shown below.

In the configuration information above, 'Version' refers to the firmware version
of the Performance Monitor, 'Max commands for averaging' refers to the maximum number of 
commands that can be saved and used for calculating the average, and 'Max latency
commands to save' refers to the maximum number of commands with high latency that 
are saved.  The number of elements in the buffer is determined by these configurations 
and the memory constraints of the system.
.Sp
To set the Drive Performance Monitor to 'enable' or 'disable', use commands 
\&\fB/cx set dpmstat=on\fR and \fB/cx set dpmstat=off\fR, respectively.
For example:
.Sp
.Vb 2

Note that there is a set of 38 'Bins' and each bin denotes a Response Time 
category.  The number of I/Os or commands that fall into the Response Time 
time range of the designated bin would fall into that bin.  In the display 
above, there are no commands with response times of 10 milliseconds or 
shorter, and there are 204 commands with 20 milliseconds.  Note that for 
the I/O application and activities to this drive, the concentration of the

To clear the running average statistics data of the specified port, 
use command \fB/cx/px set dpmstat=clear type=ra\fR.  For example:

\& Clearing Port Performance Monitor running average statistics on /c0/p3... Done.
.Ve
.Sp
Please note that this clears the Running Average and Histogram data.
.Sp
\&\fBNote:\fR Usage of the 'clear' command without specifying 'type' implies 
the default, which is 'type=ra'.  The default thus effectively clears 
both the running average statistics and histogram data.  Also, some statistics 
data types cannot be cleared, such as setting 'type=inst' or 'type=histdata'.
Attempting to clear these will return an error.

If I/O traffic to the drive has been stopped, after clearing, a
subsequent request to show the running average statistics

.Sh "Rapid \s-1RAID\s0 Recovery"
.IX Subsection "Rapid RAID Recovery"
Rapid \s-1RAID\s0 Recovery can speed up the rebuild, initialize, and verify processes
and tasks in response to an unclean system shutdown.  Effectively this feature 
provides for expedited boot-up time.  
.Sp
This feature is only supported on the 9650SE and 9690SA controllers.  In 
addition, it is only supported on redundant arrays only, such as \s-1RAID\-1\s0, \s-1RAID\-5\s0, 
\&\s-1RAID\-6\s0, \s-1RAID\-10\s0 and \s-1RAID\-50\s0.
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1OPERATION\s0\fR
.Sp
The usage of this feature consists of a set of commands that sets 
the feature to one of three possible states.  This configuration may be 
defined at unit creation time or after a unit has been created.  Below 
is a summary of the commands for this feature.
.Sp
.Vb 3
\& /cx add ... rapidrecovery=all|rebuild|disable
\& /cx/ux set rapidrecovery=all|rebuild|disable [quiet]
\& /cx/ux show rapidrecovery
.Ve
.Sp
If you set this option to \fBall\fR, upon an unclean system shutdown, the 
Rapid \s-1RAID\s0 Recovery policy will apply to rebuild, initialize, and verify tasks at 
reboot.  If you set this option to \fBrebuild\fR, then only the rebuild task will 
be applied. If you set it to \fBdisable\fR, then none of the tasks will be sped up.
Please note that once this attribute is set for the unit, the policy setting 
is persistent in the system until it is disabled.
.Sp
\&\fBNote:\fR Once the Rapid \s-1RAID\s0 Recovery has been \*(L"disabled\*(R" for a unit, it 
cannot be changed again for that unit.  As a result, if you issue the 
\&'cx/px set rapidrecovery=disable' command, a message along with a prompt for 
input to proceed will appear.  To turn off the message and prompt
for scripting purposes, use the quiet option.
.Sp
<Note:> For systems that do not support Rapid \s-1RAID\s0 Recovery, such as older 
controllers or non-redundant arrays, Rapid \s-1RAID\s0 Recovery would be set
to the default of 'disable'.  And for all supported arrays with respect 
to supported controllers, the default is set to 'all'.
.Sp
Consider a 9690SA controller with four drives attached. Creating a \s-1RAID\-5\s0 
unit with the rapidrecovery attribute set to the \fBall\fR option:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& //localhost> /c1 add type=raid5 disk=0:2:3 rapidrecovery=all
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 7
\& Creating new unit on controller /c1 ... Done. The new unit is /c1/u0.

\& Setting Rapid RAID Recovery policy on /c1/u0 to [all] ... Done.
\& Setting default Command Queuing Policy for unit /c1/u0 to [on] ... Done.
\& Setting write cache=ON for the new unit ... Done.
\& Warning: You do not have a battery backup unit for /c1/u0 and the enabled
\& write cache (default) may cause data loss in the event of power failure.

The 'disable' setting is permanent and cannot be changed to 'all' or
\&'rebuild' once it is set for the unit.  As a result an extra query has
been added for the user to confirm the change.  If the user confirms, 
this is the scenario:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\& //localhost> /c1/u0 set rapidrecovery=disable 
\& Setting Rapid RAID Recovery to disable is permanent for /c1/u0

.Sh "User Defined \s-1LUN\s0 Sizing"
.IX Subsection "User Defined LUN Sizing"
User Defined \s-1LUN\s0 Sizing, or, Variable \s-1LUN\s0 Carve, is a feature that allows
the user to specify variable sizes for volumes in a unit.  The first volume
may be considered, although not necessarily, the Boot \s-1LUN\s0.  This feature
allows the user to specify up to four volumes or LUNs in a unit.  
.Sp
You can define the \s-1LUN\s0 sizes for these array types: Raid0, Raid1, 
Raid10, Raid5, Raid50, Raid6 and Single.
.Sp
To specify Variable \s-1LUN\s0 Carve simply requires setting an attribute during unit 
creation.  However, to eliminate potential confusion with the existing
autocarve and carvesize commands, this section was created to describe
this feature along with those commands.
.Sp
If the pre-existing related commands are included, the set of \s-1LUN\s0 carve 
commands are the following:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\& /cx add ... [v0=n|vol=a:b:c:d]
\& /cx show autocarve
\& /cx show carvesize
\& /cx set autocarve=on|off
\& /cx set carvesize=[1024..32768]
.Ve
.Sp
Note that the first command associates with this feature, and the latter 
four commands have pre\-existed.  
.Sp
While the Variable \s-1LUN\s0 Sizing feature is related to the autocarve feature, 
they are independent.  If autocarve has been set to \s-1ON\s0, then the sizes of 
the volumes for that unit are set to the specifed carve-size (or the 
default).  The possible size of the carving is in the range of 
{1024..32768} \s-1GB\s0 or {1..32} \s-1TB\s0. Specifying the size(s) of the boot or 
first four volumes in essense overlays these volumes with their respective
sizes to that of the carved volume sizes.  For example, if the carvesize 
has been set to 1024GB and autocarve is \s-1ON:\s0 
.Sp
Autocarve=ON, carvesize=1024GB (1TB) 
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&   ------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+-------
\&    1024   1024   1024   1024   1024   1024   1024   1024   1024   1024   . . .
\&   ------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+-------
.Ve
.Sp
If we specify the first four \s-1LUN\s0 volumes to be 2000GB, 500GB, 1024GB, and 700GB,
then we have the following: 
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&   ------------+---+------+----+-----+------+------+------+------+------+-------
\&       2000     500  1024  700   896   1024   1024   1024   1024   1024   . . . 
\&   ------------+---+------+----+-----+------+------+------+------+------+-------
.Ve
.Sp
All numbers are in units of \s-1GB\s0.  Note the while the last specified carved size 
was 700GB, the next carved volume is not 1024GB but,
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   1024GB - (remainder of last volume carved)
.Ve
.Sp
Or:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   1024 - 128 = 896
.Ve
.Sp
The remainder of the last volume is 128GB because the four specified volumes
totaled 4224GB which exceeds the four autocarved volumes totalling 4096GB 
by 128GB.
.Sp
For the add command, at unit creation time the volume sizes could be 
specified with either the attribute \fBv0=\fR or \fBvol=\fR.  With \fBv0\fR only
the first \s-1LUN\s0 volume size could be specified.  With \fBvol\fR, up to four \s-1LUN\s0
volume sizes may be specified.  The input of size is an integer in 
gigabytes (\s-1GB\s0) and the valid range is [1..32768], the upper limit is 32TB.
.Sp
If the \fBvol=a:b:c:d\fR attribute is used, each volume is separated by the 
symbol \fB:\fR in ascending order. That is, the integer closest to \fB=\fR is 
volume 0 (v0), followed by volume 1 (v1), volume 2 (v2), etc.  The maximum 
that could be specified with this method is four volumes, or, up to v3.

.Sh "Verify"
.IX Subsection "Verify"
The Verify function is among other self-test functions such as Rebuild and 
Selftest in the \s-1RAID\s0 system.  It performs data integraty checks on an array 
unit based on the unit type.  For a \s-1RAID\-1\s0 array, for example, the verification 
involves checking that both drives contain the exact data; and on a \s-1RAID\-5\s0 
array, the parity information is used to verify data integrity.
.Sp
This feature is available on 9000 series controllers. The Verify function
requires some initial setup.  Particularly the scheduled time windows of 
the background verify tasks need to be defined.  A scheduled time window, 
or, timeslot, is part of the Verify Schedule.  
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1SET\s0 \s-1UP\s0\fR
.Sp
For the \fBVerify\fR function, the following commands are used for the 
set up:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\& /cx set verify=enable|disable|1..5
\& /cx add verify=ddd:hh:duration
\& /cx del verify=slot_id
.Ve
.Sp
The setup consists of setting Verify to enable, then adding verify 
timeslots into the Schedule.  The Schedule contains a default set of verify
timeslots defined, so specifying the verify timeslots is not necessary if
the defaults are suitable.  
.Sp
When a verify background process would initiate and run depends on more 
than the Schedule itself.  The sections below describe this in more detail.
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1AUTOVERIFY\s0\fR
.Sp
Related to this Verify function is \fBautoverify\fR.  The Autoverify setting lets
the \s-1RAID\s0 firmware determine a time to start the verify process of a unit 
automatically or at its discretion at a time suitable (but related to the 
Schedule) when it is set to \s-1ON\s0.  If a verify process has started and the verify 
task cannot complete within the scheduled window, the verify task would be 
paused and resumed later.  Again, firmware makes its decision autonomously 
based on factors such as the schedule, settings, and other higher priority 
background tasks.
.Sp
Autoverify applies to 9000 series controllers also.
.Sp
The commands associated with Autoverify are the following:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\& - /cx/ux set autoverify=on|off
\& - /cx/ux show autoverify
.Ve
.Sp
Autoverify is also an attribute that could be set at unit creation.  The
setting of autoverify is \s-1ON\s0 if Basic Verify (see \fBVerify \- Basic\fR section)
is supported, otherwise the default is set to \s-1OFF\s0.  
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1MANUAL\s0 \s-1VERIFY\s0\fR
.Sp
Also related to the Verify function is Manual verify, where a background
verify process or task for a unit could be started and stopped manually.  
The following is the set of commands associated with this:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\& /cx/ux start verify
\& /cx/ux stop verify
.Ve
.Sp
Note that if subsequent to this command, one enables the background verify 
task to follow the scheduled slots, then this on-demand task will be paused 
until the next scheduled timeslot.
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1VERIFY\s0 \s-1STATUS\s0\fR
.Sp
Finally, to see the status of the tasks associated with the Verify function,
the set of commands for that is the following:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\& show verify
\& /cx show verify
\& /cx/ux show verifystatus
\& /cx/ux show autoverify
.Ve
.Sp
Here is an example of the show verify command.

Syntax\fR section of this document.
.Sp
Since these set of commands are related but serve different functions with 
respect to Verify, how they work together determines when a background verify 
process would initiate and run.  Thus it is important to note their interactions.  
The following table summarizes the setting parameters and corresponding system 
response relative to the Verify function and when a verify task may run.

.Sh "Verify \- Advanced"
.IX Subsection "Verify - Advanced"
Advanced Verify is actually the Verify function of the previous section, intended
for advanced users, in systems where Basic Verify is supported.  Advanced/Basic 
Verify is supported on 9650SE and 9690SA controllers.  In such systems, to set 
to Advanced Verify as opposed to Basic Verify, you would set verify=advanced 
with the command:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& /cx set verify=advanced|basic|1..5
.Ve
.Sp
If the system does not support Advanced/Basic Verify, you would get the following 
error:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\& //localhost> /c2 set verify=advanced
\& Error: (CLI:146) Basic/Advanced Verify is not supported for the specified controller.
.Ve
.Sp
In this case you could still set Verify to enable/disable.  (See previous section.)
If Advanced/Basic is supported on your system, after issuing this command, all other 
commands for Advanced Verify is identical to Verify that was presented in the previous 
section.
.Sp
We will show a setup scenario to demonstrate how the commands are used with respect 
to this feature.  For a \s-1RAID\s0 system with the following arrays and drives, we will 
show the usage of the commands along with examples.  Please note that this system
has a 9690SA controller with the firmware that also supports Basic Verify.

.Sh "Verify \- Basic"
.IX Subsection "Verify - Basic"
As a result of the complexity and non-deterministic nature of Verify or 
Advanced Verify with respect to when scheduled verify tasks may execute, the
Basic Verify feature was introduced to provide a more simplistic verify 
function as an option.
.Sp
Basic Verify does not change the current Verify function. But supplies the 
user a means to specify a preferred day and time for a weekly background verify 
task to be executed.  If the preferred day and time is not specified, a default
is provided.  The setting is simplier and when a scheduled verify task would 
run is more deterministic and straight\-forward.
.Sp
Before using Basic Verify, it is important to know if your system supports
Advanced/Basic Verify.  Generally, this is supported in 9650SE and 9690SA controllers
only.  If the system does not support Advanced/Basic Verify, you would get the following 
error:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\& //localhost> /c2 set verify=advanced
\& Error: (CLI:146) Basic/Advanced Verify is not supported for the specified controller.

.RS 4
If you wish to use \s-1CLI\s0 in single command mode (not interactive), make sure to avoid
collision with your command interpreter (\s-1OS\s0 shell) by escaping the meta-characters
(such as ?, <, >, @, &, *, etc) appropriately with single quote around them.
.Sp
For example, given the
.Sp
$ tw_cli /c0 ?
.Sp
This is a case of single command usage where the user intends to get help on Controller
related commands.  While this is a valid \s-1CLI\s0 command, but since the arguments to \s-1CLI\s0
are first processed by the shell, then some shells like \fIcsh\fR\|(1) will interpret the '?' as
a meta-character to be used toward file completion and if no file is found with a single
character, then shell will complain before the arguments are even passed down to \s-1CLI\s0.
.Sp
One solutions of this problem can be :
.Sp
$ tw_cli help /cx
.Sp
or
.Sp
$ tw_cli '/c0 ?'
.Sp
Note:  Some of the \s-1OS\s0 shell does not have this problem such as bash.

.Sh "Reporting Style"
.IX Subsection "Reporting Style"
\&\fItw_cli\fR\|(8) reporting has changed (hopefully for better). The intent has been to
provide a consistent tabular reporting so that relevant and important information 
(such as \fBinfo\fR) are made available as fast as possible. For example, firmware,
\&\s-1PCB\s0, \s-1PCHIP\s0 and similar information have been removed from the info summary report, 
as this type of information is not frequently needed.
.Sp
The new style also accommodates automation much better by providing consistent 
columns with or without values so that it could be easily parsed. The intent is
to make \s-1CLI\s0 yet another \s-1API\s0 (to approach it).
.Sp
However to accommodate current automations around tw_cli and to ease the migration,
the old behavior can still be requested by setting \fB\s-1TW_CLI_STYLE\s0\fR 
environment variable to \fB\s-1OLD\s0\fR as follows:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\& If Bash, then "export TW_CLI_STYLE=OLD"
\& If csh, then "setenv TW_CLI_STYLE OLD"
\& if Windows, then "set TW_CLI_STYLE=OLD"
.Ve
.Sp
This backward compatibility window, will be communicated by official AMCC/3ware representatives.
.Sh "Initialization Process Control"
.IX Subsection "Initialization Process Control"
On the 9K series of controllers, the rebuild scheduling controls both rebuild and
initialize processes if it is enabled.  Currently, \fItw_cli\fR\|(8)
does not have any direct command to pause or resume an initialization process.
If such action is needed, use the rebuild scheduling to handle it.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.IX Header "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
\&\s-1TW_CLI_STYLE\s0 setting this variable to \s-1OLD\s0, will provide the old reporting style.
