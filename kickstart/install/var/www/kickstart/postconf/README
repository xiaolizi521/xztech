README: Kickstart Postconfguration

Description:
This file describes the contents of this directory and how it is used in the ServerBeach
Kickstart system.  Its intent is to give the developer and system administrator a  guide
into the SB Provisioning process from a stand point of post configuration.

postconf.txt -  This file is called by redhat based installs.  It handles basic postinstall setup and the
                puliing down of modules to be installed.

debian/      -  This directory contains postinstall information for debian installations.

                postinstall.txt - this file is run immediately after the installation is complete 
                                  but before the system reboots.

                postconf.txt    - this file is responsible for basic system setups and pulling down postboot.txt

                postboot.txt    - this contains post boot instructions.  It is pulled down as sbpost.real and
                                  is called during startup on the next system boot.

modules/     -  This directory contains modules for installing selected components.  The modules are 
                (for the most part) shell scripts called by the postconf.txt files and handle downloading
                and installing extra components (most prominently, control panels).
