# Generated iptables firewall script for the Linux 2.4 kernel
# Script generated by Easy Firewall Generator for IPTables 1.15
# copyright 2002 Timothy Scott Morizot
# 
# Redhat chkconfig comments - firewall applied early,
#                             removed late
# chkconfig: 2345 08 92
# description: This script applies or removes iptables firewall rules
# 
# This generator is primarily designed for RedHat installations,
# although it should be adaptable for others.
#
# It can be executed with the typical start and stop arguments.
# If used with stop, it will stop after flushing the firewall.
# The save and restore arguments will save or restore the rules
# from the /etc/sysconfig/iptables file.  The save and restore
# arguments are included to preserve compatibility with
# Redhat's or Fedora's init.d script if you prefer to use it.

# Redhat/Fedora installation instructions
#
# 1. Have the system link the iptables init.d startup script into run states
#    2, 3, and 5.
#    chkconfig --level 235 iptables on
#
# 2. Save this script and execute it to load the ruleset from this file.
#    You may need to run the dos2unix command on it to remove carraige returns.
#
# 3. To have it applied at startup, copy this script to
#    /etc/init.d/iptables.  It accepts stop, start, save, and restore
#    arguments.  (You may wish to save the existing one first.)
#    Alternatively, if you issue the 'service iptables save' command
#    the init.d script should save the rules and reload them at runtime.
#
# 4. For non-Redhat systems (or Redhat systems if you have a problem), you
#    may want to append the command to execute this script to rc.local.
#    rc.local is typically located in /etc and /etc/rc.d and is usually
#    the last thing executed on startup.  Simply add /path/to/script/script_name
#    on its own line in the rc.local file.
