# If you're going to protect the portmapper use the name "portmap" for the
# daemon name. Remember that you can only use the keyword "ALL" and IP
# addresses (NOT host or domain names) for the portmapper, as well as for
# rpc.mountd (the NFS mount daemon). See portmap(8), rpc.mountd(8) and 
# /usr/share/doc/portmap/portmapper.txt.gz for further information.
