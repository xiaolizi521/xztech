This directory will be structured as follows:

Each user will have a unique uuid, generated upon installation of the script originally.

Each users sig information will then be stored hierarchally as follows:

./uuid/bgs - Background Images
./uuid/fonts - Fonts
./uuid/sigs - Signature(S)
./uuid/img - This will never be used by the user, entirely for the system itself. This will be used to store the 'layers' for the sigs when generated.
