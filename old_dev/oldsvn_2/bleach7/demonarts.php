<br />
Demon arts are spells used by shinigami to do various things such as binding, attacking, and healing. Only upper level shinigami can use them after sufficient training.  There are two types of Demon Arts: Bakudou (&quot;binding spell&quot;) and Hadou (&quot;blast spell&quot;).  Demon Arts are classified by power and difficulty of casting in a numbering scheme from 1 through 99, with power and difficulty increasing with the number.  If a shinigami masters demon arts, they will gain the ability to bypass the incantation while casting spells.<br />
