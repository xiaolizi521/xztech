<br />
</span><span class="VerdanaSize1Main"><br />
<b>Q. What is this section for?</b><br />
<br />
For moderators to refer new and problem users to learn the rules of the comments section.<br />
<br />
<b>Q. Okay, so what IS spam?</b><br />
<br />
Useless posts unrelated to the post topic (or general anime).  A post that doesn't have to do with anything, such as a bunch of nonsensical text, a smiley face, or a phrase that doesn't contribute anything such as &quot;w00t&quot; or &quot;i don't know&quot; etc. Ask a moderator for more detailed examples of spam.<br />
<br />
<b>Q. Is there a place on Bleach7 where I can talk about unrelated topics?</b><br />
<br />
Yes, anything unrelated to the post topic can be discussed in the <a href="?page=chat/index">chatroom.</a><br />
<br />
<b>Q. What is a double post?</b><br />
<br />
It's where one user posts twice in a row.<br />
<br />
<b>Q. What's wrong with double posting?</b><br />
<br />
It's not needed seeing as there is an edit button on the upper right side of your comment.<br />
<br />
<b>Q. What is post counting?</b><br />
<br />
When a user says the number of their post inside the post (especially &quot;FIRST!&quot;).<br />
<br />
<b>Q. What's wrong with post counting?</b><br />
<br />
It's unnecessary, as Bleach7 automatically labels each post with its number.  We trust that you can count perfectly well, so there is no need to show us.<br />
<br />
<b>Q. What does my rank mean?</b><br />
<br />
It just give a general idea of how many posts you have made. Optionally, it can be used to showoff how awesome you are.<br />
<br />
<b>Q. What are the different ranks?</b><br />
<br />
Bleach7 has a unique ranking system that lets you decide which side you want to support! Once you reach 50 posts, you can go into the "Edit Profile" option, and choose whether you want to support Soul Society or Hueco Mundo.
<br /><br />
0 and below: Condemned Soul<br />
1-9: Spiritless<br />
10-24: Human<br />
25-49 Spirit Medium<br />
50-99: Plus Soul/Earthbound Spirit<br />
100-199: Rukongai Soul/Demi-Hollow<br />
200-399: Shinigami/Hollow<br />
400-649: Seated Officer/Gillian<br />
650-999: Vice-Captain/Adjucha<br />
1000-????: Captain/Vasto Lorde<br />
????+: Vizard/Arrancar<br />
<br />
<b>Q. How do I rank up?</b><br />
<br />
Your rank is linked to the number of posts that you have made, so just post more without spamming.<br />
<br />
<b>Q. When do I use a spoiler tag?</b><br />
<br />
When your comment contains information that has happened in the manga, but not in the anime yet.  It is to protect the members who only watch the anime from accidently stumbling upon information that may spoil the anime for them.<br />
<br />
<b>Q. Why should I use a URL tag for my links?</b><br />
<br />
For convenience.  It is a lot easier to tell what a link directs to if you label it.  Also, it helps to keep the comment pages neat, because links that are too long will stretch the comment pages.<br />
<br />
<b>Q. How do I use a tag? [Spoiler, Link, Bold, etc]</b><br />
<br />
To use a tag, look for the corresponding button at the top of the comment type box and click it, then type what you want the tag to effect in between the two tags.  Example: [spoiler]type spoiler text here[/spoiler]<br />
<br />
<b>Q. Why did my websites link get removed from my comment?</b><br />
<br />
Advertising is not allowed in the comments here at Bleach7. Ask a moderator if you're not sure if a certain link can be used in comments.<br />
<br />
<b>Q. Why did my post count get lowered/reset?</b><br />
<br />
You may have repeated an offense of the above rules and the result was a lowered post count.<br />
<br />
<b>Q. Why am I banned from commenting?</b><br />
<br />
You may have broken the above rules more than one time... or you may have just pissed off The Lurking Staffie. Either are valid reasons for a ban.<br />
<br />
<b>Q. Can I apply to become a comment moderator?</b><br />
<br />
Not exactly. We choose the mods based on when we feel we need more to watch over the ever-growing comments. They will be active, law-abiding members, who have been around for a while and know the comment section well.<br />
