Website Statistics<br />
<br />
</font><font face="Verdana" size="1">A lot of people have been curious as of 
late to know exactly how much traffic Bleach7 gets and how we compare to several 
other large anime websites. So, I am going to try and help answer some of these 
questions by using various tools around the web. Below are some Q&amp;As.<br />

<br />
<b>Q: How many hits does Bleach7.com get every day/week/month?</b><br />
A: Well it varies really. We haven't really had any major declines in visitors 
ever since we started the website (if you don't include our little three month stretch of downtime), it usually averages out for a month or so, 
then climbs a bit, then repeat. At the time of writing, the last month or two 
we've been averaging around 200,000 page views per day (about 6 million page views per month) but different days of the 
week give different results, so it's hard to give an exact number.<br />
<br />
<b>Q: How much bandwidth does Bleach7 go through in a month? (Both Website/Media)</b><br />
A: <b><i><u>Website:</u></i></b> As of the last 6 months, Bleach7 has averaged 
just over 900 GB/month on its website server, which hosts both Bleach7.com and BleachForums.com. <u><b><i>Media:</i></b></u> 
Over the past few months, Bleach7 has 
averaged over 10 terabytes of bandwidth per month (terabyte meaning 1024 gigabytes) for our 
media downloads. If you had a 250 GB hard drive, that would be equivalent to transferring the entire contents of it 40 times over! We expect this to grow as we have more visitors/members join.<br />
<br />
<b>Q: How does Bleach7 compare in visitors/hits to other popular websites?</b><br />
A: Thanks to Alexa.com, I was able to use one of their many valuable tools to 
create a graph showing this. We used several popular websites to compare to 
Bleach7, and this graph will update constantly to show a running comparison. The 
websites chosen to use were BleachForums, Bleach Portal, Naruto Fan, and 
AnimeSuki.<br />
