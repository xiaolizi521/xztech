Bleach7 and Bleach Forums were created with one goal in mind: to spread the Bleach that we knew and loved to all the anime fans that we possibly could. Bleach Forums was opened on September 2nd, 2004 and we were quite amazed at the large numbers of fans it attracted in such a short time, especially without an accompanying website to aid it in advertising. Later that year, on October 1st, 2004, we finally got to open Bleach7.com, but we didn't have much at all. A few pages of information, a small staff of maybe three or four members, and we pretty much thought that Bleach7 would never get off the ground and that Bleach Forums would be the main attraction.
<br /><br />
Within a month of opening Bleach7, we were all in shock. We had gotten nearly 5,000 members by the end of October and we were still growing! Little did we know that almost four years later, five layout versions, several setbacks, a good share of downtime, plenty of complaining emails, enough Garden Herb Triscuits to sink a small boat, and a Mountain Dew for every hour we spent working on this site, would we be so large. Nearly half a million members and a staff of over 20 members at the time of writing and growing at quite an incredible rate.
<br /><br />
All we can really say is that Bleach7 is a fan-sustained community now and without you, the members, we wouldn't be what where we are today.
