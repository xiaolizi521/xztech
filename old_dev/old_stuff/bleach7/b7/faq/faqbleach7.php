</font><font face="Verdana" size="1">&nbsp;- Questions pertaining to Bleach7.com are in here.<br />
<br />
<b>Q. What is Bleach7.com?</b><br />
<br />
A domain name... duh.<br />
<br />
<b>Q. I mean the site!</b><br />

A: Oh... right, it's an ever-growing community of Bleach-fanatics.<br />
<br />
<b>Q. Where did the 7 come from?</b><br />
<br />
It originally was going to be a Bleach/Samurai7 website, but we dropped Samurai7 because of the success of Bleach.<br />
<br />
<b>Q. When was the site opened?</b><br />
<br />
Bleach7 opened its doors on October 1st, 2004, a few days before the first episode of Bleach aired on TV Tokyo. We were the first of the "big" Bleach fansite to be started.<br />
<br />

Kon, aka Daniel, aka Master, aka AKA, aka etc, okay?<br />

<b>Q. Did you create Bleach?</b><br />
<br />
No we did not, Bleach was created by Kubo Tite. <br />
<br />
<b>Q. Why have you not updated [insert Bleach7 page here]?</b><br />
<br />
Well, there could be many reason.  One, we don't have all of the information needed to update the said page.  Two, we are working on this site on our own time.  We will get to the said page as soon as we can.  So if you can site back and wait just a bit more, we will update the page.  Trust me in that we want to have Bleach7 the one stop people will go for information on Bleach.  But it is going to take time.<br />
<br />
