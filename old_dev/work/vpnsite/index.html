			<h1>RSA & TWO FACTOR AUTHENTICATION</h1>
			
				<blockquote>
				
					<p>Recently we began deployment of the RSA tags required for the Two Factor authentication process.</p>
					
					<p>If you have received one of these tags, you will need to adjust your Cisco VPN Client appropriately.</p>
					
					<p>Please go <a href="rsa.html">here</a> for instructions on how to do this.</p>
					
					<p>Thanks!</p>
					
					<p>- RITS Service Desk</p>

			<h1>Important Note about Vista</h1>
				
				<blockquote>
					<p>We now have an approved client for Windows Vista. You can obtain it below. The instructions for Windows XP will also be the same as for Windows Vista. Please follow them to configure your client. Thanks!</p>
				</blockquote>
			
			<h1>Introduction</h1>

				<blockquote>

					<p>
						This document will assist you with retrieving, installing, and configuring the Cisco VPN client. Once configured, you will be able to access and utilize all of the internal systems within Rackspace, as well as remote into your local Desktop and retreive files that you may need to work on while away.</p>
						
						<h2>Important Things to Consider</h2>
						
						<p>
						
							<strong>
								
								<ol>
									
									<li>You can check your email from the web, without VPNing in. If you open up Internet Explorer and point your browser to <a href="http://rackermail.rackspace.com">http://rackermail.rackspace.com</a> (or if you are on IMAP, <a href="http://mail.rackspace.com">http://mail.rackspace.com</a>), you will be able to view all of your email online. Please consider this if you are only needing to VPN in to check email, as this may be easier for you.</li>
									
									<li>Rackspace RITS does not currently support Windows Vista. Additionally, we do not currently have a working Windows Vista VPN Client. At this time, we do not have any available workarounds for this issue.</li>
									
									
								
								</ol>
							
							</strong>
						
						</p>
					
					</blockquote>

				<h1>Before we begin...</h1>


					<blockquote>
					
						<p>Before we begin, we must first verify that you are properly able to connect to VPN. The RITS Service Desk can make sure that everything is set up properly on our end to allow you to access the internal systems properly. You will need to contact the service desk at either extension 4357 (from outside Rackspace you can dial (210) 312-4357) or open a GENIE Support Ticket. You will be asked a small amount of information before we can verify everything from you:

							<strong>
								
								<ol>
	
									<li>Jack # or General Location with detailed landmarks</li>
									
									<li>Department</li>
								</ol>
							</strong>
						</p>

						<p>Once we have this information, we will verify that your VPN Group and VLANs are set up properly, which govern your access privileges on the network. At this point, we will proceed with getting you set up.</p>
						
						<h2>What does VPN Require?</h2>
						
						<p>First and Foremost, VPN requires that you have an internet connection at home. Also, if you are using a laptop, and would like to work wirelessly, you will need to be sure that you have a Wireless Router and that it is functioning properly.</p>
						
						<p><strong>Important</strong><p>
						
						<p>If you have a router in your house, there is a chance that you may not be able to VPN in. This is most commonly caused by the router's Firewall, however, it also can occur if the router has incompatibilities with VPN. In the event that you cannot VPN in, please contact the Service Desk at x4357 (or (210) 312-4357) and we will go through some diagnostics.</p>
						
						<h2>What if I run into problems?</h2>
						
						<p>If you happen to run into any unfortunate difficulties while trying to either VPN in or connect to your computer, you are in luck! The RITS Service Desk is available 24 hours a day beginning Sunday Night at 10:30pm to Saturday Morning at 4:30am. You can contact us here at any time at the extension x4357 (xHELP), or from outside Rackspace by dialing (210) 312-4357. We should be able to get you up and running as quickly as possible.</p>
						
						<h2>How can I avoid running into problems?</h2>
						
						<p>The best way to avoid running into problems with either connecting via VPN or remoting into your computer, is to contact the help desk prior to leaving for the day when you know you will be needing to connect remotely from home or while away from rackspace for an extended period. This gives us the opprotunity to verify that everything is set up properly on our end, including your desktop as well as your VLANs and VPN group settings.</p>
						
						<h2>Important Things to Note</h2>
						
						<p>If you have been able to VPN into Rackspace before but are now unable to, this is most likely due to a common problem - Rackspace Growth. VPN access and your VPN group are tied to VLANs that pertain to the physical jack located at your desk. One of the most common problems results from the normal movement that we experience here at Rackspace. The best way to prevent any problems due to this is to contact us prior to moving so that we can make sure that you transition properly into your new location. This will also prevent you from running into any unforeseen downtime while at your new location due to any jack problems. When you contact us, please be sure to include your <strong>old jack #</strong> and <strong>new jack #</strong> so that we can ensure proper settings.</p>

				<h2>Obtaining and Installing the Cisco VPN Client</h2>

				<blockquote>

					<h3>Obtaining the VPN Client</h3>
	
	
					
						<p>Before you can connect to the network, you will need to download the VPN client installer. You will need to select the proper client for the operating system you are running. All of the below links are the most up to date version of the Cisco VPN Client that Rackspace supports. If you have a different version, we will do our best to assist you with connecting, but we cannot guarantee that it will work. The links for each of these versions are as follows:
						</p>
	
						<a href = "https://ftp.rackspace.com/vpn/vpnclient-darwin-4.9.01.0080-universal-k9.dmg">Mac OS X VPN Client (Universal - Works on both Intel and PPC)</a><br />
						<a href = "https://ftp.rackspace.com/vpn/vpnclient-linux-x86_64-4.8.00.0490-k9.tar.gz">Linux VPN Client</a><br />
						<a href = "https://ftp.rackspace.com/vpn/vpnclient-win-msi-5.0.01.0600-k9.exe">Windows VPN Client</a>
					
					<h3>Installing and Setting Up The Client</h3>
	
						<p>Now that you have downloaded the VPN client files, you need to install them. For your convenience and easy access, the install pages have been divided up into different sections depending on your system. Please be aware that while we have pages up for Mac and Linux, we do not currently support these operating systems at the RITS Service Desk and any troubleshooting will be "best effort."
