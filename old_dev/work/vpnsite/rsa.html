			<h1>RSA & Two Factor Authentication</h1>
			
				<blockquote>
				
					<p>The RITS Service Desk, as well as your IS Infrastructure Team, in conjuction with Rackspace Corporate Security, are currently working to fully implement and deploy a Two Factor authentication system with our VPN and Wireless Internet Access.</p>
					
					<p><strong>Please note, these instructions work for both Mac OS X and Windows XP/Vista. The instructions for Linux systems will be coming soon. Thank you for your patience in this matter.</strong></p>
					
				</blockquote>
				
				<h2>What does this mean?</h2>
				
					<blockquote>
					
						<p>This means that in order to VPN or access the Wireless Network here at rackpace, you will need to obtain an RSA token. This RSA token has a unique number that changes every 60 seconds. This number, as well as a 4 to 8 digit PIN that the service desk will assist you in setting up, will become your new password for both VPN and Wireless Access.</p>
					
					</blockquote>
					
				<h2>I have a tag already, now what?</h2>
				
					<blockquote>
					
						<p>If you have already obtained a RSA tag from the service desk, you are now ready to begin configuring your VPN client.</p>
						
						<ol>
							<p>To start, download this <a href="rsavpn.pcf">file</a> and save it to your Desktop</p>
							
							<p>After downloading the file, open up your Cisco VPN Client.</p>
							
							<img src="images/rsa/1.png">
							
							<p>Once the VPN Client is open, click on the "Import" button at the top of the screen. In the above picture, the pointer is by the appropriate button.</p>
							
							<img src="images/rsa/2.png">
							
							<p>Browse to the file you just downloaded on your desktop, and double click on it.</p>

							<img src="images/rsa/3.png">
							
							<p>The VPN Client will say that the file has been succesfully imported. It will be named "rsavpn" in your list of available connections.</p>

							<img src="images/rsa/4.png">
							
							<p>To change the name of the entry, select it and hit "Modify" at the top of the screen.</p>
							
							<img src="images/rsa/5.png">							
							
							<p>Enter the name that you wish into the box labeled "Connection Entry."</p>						
							
							<p>You can change the name to whatever you like.</p>

				<h2>After setting up your VPN client...</h2>
				
					<blockquote>
					
						<p>After you have set up your VPN client, you will be able to connect to this connection normally. Simply select this connection and click "Connect." After connecting, you will be presented with a familiar username and password screen.</p>
						
						<p><strong>Your username is your normal SSO username.</strong></p>
						
						<p><strong>Your password, is the 4-8 DIGIT PIN PLUS the 6 DIGIT NUMBER from your RSA tag.</strong></p>
						
					</blockquote>
				
				<h2>How do I obtain an RSA tag?</h2>
				
					<blockquote>
					
						<p>The RITS Service Desk will be contacting your team managers so that we may coordinate in a easy method with as little confusion as possible. They will be able to let you know when you will be receiving your RSA tag for VPN access.</p>
