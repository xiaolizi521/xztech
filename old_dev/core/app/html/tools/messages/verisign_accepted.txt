Dear Rackspace Customer:

Your Verisign Certificate application was accepted by Verisign.
Rackspace technical support will be installing this certificate on your
server.  If you should have additional questions, please do not hesitate
to contact your Rackspace Customer Care Team.

One feature you may want along with your new certificate is a Verisign
logo on your site.  Their brand is widely recognized as a symbol of
security on the Internet.

Verisign has instituted a "self-serve" feature on the web site to allow
you to obtain your customer Issuer Digest (ID) number, which then allows
you to obtain your new Secure Site Seal.

For an explanation of the new program and installation instructions for
the new seal, please go to:
http://www.verisign.com/seal/secure/index.html

In this process, please pay special attention to copying the "Issuer
Digest" ID number (not the serial number or order number or any other
number).  To locate the Issuer Digest #, use the following link's
directions:

If you have any further questions or comments about the Seal program,
please contact Rackspace Customer Care or Verisign Secure Seal Support
at (877) 438-8776 seal-support@verisign.com

Thank you,

Rackspace Customer Care
