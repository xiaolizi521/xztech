<h1>After Hours Emergency Procedures</h1>
<ol>
  <li> Verify that other Rackers are having a problem with CORE. If the problem is with MyRackspace send an
  email to <a href="mailto:web911@lists.rackspace.com">web911@lists.rackspace.com</a>.  If the problem is with
  any other system then email <a href="mailto:systems911@rackspace.com">systems911@rackspace.com</a>.</li>
  <li> Submit a ticket and mark as an "Emergency", if possible.</li>
  <li> Report the problem to your supervisor.</li>
  <li> Your supervisor will make a determination if this is a problem that can't be worked around. If not, your supervisor will call the Service Desk at x700-4357.</li>
  <li> That's it! Someone from the Service Desk will contact you to help diagnose the problem.</li>
</ol>
Thank you for following this procedure when reporting problems after normal business hours. With your help, 
issues will be solved quickly and efficiently so we can get you back up and running in as short a time as possible.
