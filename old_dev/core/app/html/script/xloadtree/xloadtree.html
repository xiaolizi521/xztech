<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>About a year ago Emil visited me while I was living in USA and he came up with
a brilliant idea for a next generation DHTML tree. After some discussions about this
it took shape and in the end it turned out to be one of the best DHTML tree scripts
I've ever seen.</p>

<p>Since the original <a href="/dhtml/xtree/">xTree</a> script is implemented using
Object Oriented JS it is very easy to extend and as soon as it started to take shape
we got some wild ideas on how one could extend the tree. One idea that Emil implemented
in the original tree was to add support for persistance. Another idea I had some time
later was to allow subtrees to be loaded and populated at runtime. For this to work
the <a href="/dhtml/xtree/">xTree</a> had to be updated a little to support data model
changes at runtime. Emil added support for this after a while and now nothing was in my
way to add the dynamic loading support.</p>

<h3>Dynamic loading</h3>

<p>The XLoadTree is an extended version of the <a href="/dhtml/xtree/">xTree</a> and it
allows you to define a source property for each tree item that points to an xml file
that is then loaded, transformed using DOM and inserted using tree item methods. The
basic mechanism for this has been working for a long time but since I wanted to cover the
<a href="/dhtml/xmlextras/xmlextras.html">xml loading mechanisms</a> before writing
this article it is not until now that I can publish this.</p>

<h3>Known Issues</h3>

<p>The persistance from the original <a href="/dhtml/xtree/">xTree</a> is not
sophisticated enough for dynamic loaded trees because the original persistance is
dependent on the order of insertion and not the path. I will try to fix this in a later
update.</p>

<p>The xml object has some issues when using the file protocol (in IE) so this one only
works when located on a web server. I'll see what can be done about this.</p>
