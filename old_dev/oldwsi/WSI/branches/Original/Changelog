* Colour blocks are now updated when their related input boxes lose focus, rather than when the value is changed. Seems more reliable.

* Added protection to make the statistics page less spammy by checking if the $page variable is defined first.

* Big-assed logo at the top of the page now actually links back to the home page.

* Fonts can now be uploaded with any kind of permutation of ttf, as in tTf, Ttf and so on.

* The function call to create the actual text for the users stats is now not put twice in the code.
