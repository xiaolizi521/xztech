<br />
The midday sun&rsquo;s glare shines right on top of the sandy dunes. The ocean a clear blue stretches into the far distance. Only a few clouds are moving, signifying the coming afternoon ocean breeze. A lonely red car is travelling down the hill and up the gravel road in much need of repair. The waves of heat can be clearly seen by anyone travelling at this time of day. In the opposite direction, an old man is slowly moving up the road. Wearing a straw hat and sunglasses he is quietly passing under the sun&rsquo;s glare. He pauses and looks up at the car heading towards him. His eyes begin to widen. His body tense. Sheer terror swamps him.<br />
<br />
&lsquo;kooooooooniiiiiiicchhiiiiiiiiiwaaaaaaaa oooooooooojiiiiiiiiiiiii-saaaaannnnnnn!!!!!!!!&rsquo;<br />
<br />
screams a little blonde short haired girl waving frantically, half her body out the window, with a grin on her face. The car is swerving violently from left to right occupying the whole road, or what is left of it. Now much more up close, the old man can see an orange haired teenager and what seems to be a middle aged man fighting in the front seats. Arms flailing, a flying kick from the boy barely misses the black haired girl that&rsquo;s half climbed into the front. She seems to be trying to keep the car on the road with a well recognised annoyed look on her small face. A well aimed punch by the orange haired boy strikes the older man in the driver&rsquo;s seat. He&rsquo;s manages to get his head pushed against the window by the young teenagers foot. Now closer, the yelling coming from the small vehicle can be heard.<br />
<br />
&lsquo;You&rsquo;re just getting us lost!&rsquo; The orange haired boy shouts angrily at the man in the driver&rsquo;s seat who still has his face pushed against the window.<br />
&lsquo;No I&rsquo;m not, the beach is right there! Can&rsquo;t you see it!&rsquo; The man shouts back, trying to get the teenager&rsquo;s foot off his face that was now driving his face into the window.<br />
&lsquo;This road is leading away from the beach! You can&rsquo;t even read a stupid map!&rsquo; the young boy retorted in response to the man&rsquo;s answer.<br />
&lsquo;Oniisan! Papa! Both of you stop it! This is no time to be fighting!&rsquo; The young blonde haired girl cries.<br />
&lsquo;No point Yuzu, just wait til they cool down.&rsquo; The black haired girl mutters as she steers veeringly down the road. Now seeing to be wearing a red hat the young black haired girl meets the old man&rsquo;s stare.<br />
<br />
&lsquo;Hey look. A local. Let&rsquo;s ask him for directions. Put on the breaks.&rsquo;<br />
<br />
The old man is frozen to the spot, stunned. As the car veers towards him the old man shuts his eyes waiting for the impact. The tyres come screaming to a halt no more than a metre away from the old man. The old man&rsquo;s eyes are still closed. His knees are shaking uncontrollably. His sunglasses have slid off revealing his shut eyes.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;Ooji-san?&rdquo; a girl&rsquo;s voice squeaked when the old man doesn&rsquo;t reply.<br />
<br />
The old man slowly opens one eye, knees still shaking.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;Eh.. I&rsquo;m still alive..&rdquo; he mutters to himself.<br />
&ldquo;Oi, Ooji-san, can you tell us how to get to the beach.&rdquo; The black haired young girl asks still clutching the wheel.<br />
<br />
The man in the driver&rsquo;s seat still has his face pressed against the window by the orange boy&rsquo;s foot.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;Yes, which ways the beach?&rdquo; the man manages to voice out, even though his mouth is at the moment locking lips with the side window.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;Onii-san, don&rsquo;t kick Papa in the face!&rdquo; the young blonde girl tells off the orange haired teenager.<br />
&ldquo;Hmph.&rdquo; The orange haired boy just pushes his foot further onto his father&rsquo;s face.<br />
&ldquo;Onii-san! Stop it or you won&rsquo;t get lunch!&rdquo; the blonde haired girl now yells, face going pink.<br />
<br />
Reluctantly the orange haired teenager takes foot from his father&rsquo;s face, and sits in his seat, staring out his open window.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;Ooji-saannnnnn?&rdquo; The black haired young girl now ask, when the old man still hasn&rsquo;t said anything.<br />
Still unable to move fully, the old man lifts his left arm and shakily points down the direction they were headed. <br />
<br />
&ldquo; See Ichigo!&rdquo; says the man in the driver&rsquo;s seat folding his arms.<br />
&ldquo;Papa knew this was the right way! You have so little faith in Papa, it brings me to tears.&rdquo; he says, with no response from the orange haired boy.<br />
He clutches the picture of a woman hanging off the rear view mirror as tears start streaming down his face.<br />
&ldquo;See Mama, see how he treats me! What did I do to deserve this? I&rsquo;m just trying to be a good father and mother role model but it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be working, help me Mama!&rdquo; wails the man bowing his head.<br />
<br />
&ldquo; Onii-san you shouldn&rsquo;t make Papa cry like that!&rdquo; scolds the short haired blonde girl raising a wagging finger.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;Hmph!&rdquo; is all is heard from the orange haired boy as he continues to stare out the window, his face resting on his fist, while his father is still crying and clutching the picture.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;Ah well we better get going, thanks for the directions ooji-san!&rdquo; says the black haired girl raising a hand in thanks and winking.<br />
&ldquo;Yea, thanks oojisan! Have a great day!&rdquo; said the blonde haired girl sitting next to her with another huge smile on her face. <br />
<br />
&ldquo;Just put your foot on the accelerator, I&rsquo;ll keep driving cheh-&ldquo;says the black haired girl to the man. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re in no condition to drive.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
&ldquo;What!!!&rdquo; the man exclaims. &ldquo;Yes I am! I&rsquo;m perfectly fine! See-&ldquo;he retorts as the man jumps out of the car, punching the air.<br />
&ldquo;Papa&rsquo;s just fine! I can still drive us to the beach!&rdquo; <br />
The black haired girl just gives him a glare, mouth turning into a grimace.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon papa! We have to hurry it&rsquo;s already midday!&rdquo; says the short blonde haired girl with an anxious look on her face trying to get him back into the car.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile it seems like the man is still talking to the ocean that&rsquo;s visible from the road.<br />
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m perfectly fine! See how Papa&rsquo;s got a huge smile on his face! Papa will buy you all ice cream today! I&rsquo;m such a great father!...&rdquo;<br />
<br />
&ldquo;Eh. He&rsquo;s gotten like that again&rdquo; says the black haired girl with a sigh. <br />
&ldquo;Well we better snap him out of it. Ichigo, can you start the car.&rdquo;<br />
The orange haired boy reaches over and turns the key to turn on the engine. The man seems oblivious, still talking to himself hand on his hips.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;But what about Papa!&rdquo; exclaims the short haired blonde girl clutching onto the headrest in front of her.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry Yuzu, he&rsquo;ll be fine.&rdquo; the black haired girl replies. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
The car tyres let go with a screech and the car once again rambles down the road with less swerving than before. Hearing the loud screech, the man lost in his rantings turns around suddenly.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;EHHHHHHHH!! Where are you guys going! I&rsquo;m meant to be driving! None of you know even how to drive! Eh!! Wait for PAPAAAAAAAA...&rdquo;<br />
<br />
And in an instant, he takes off after the car still veering down the road, though not so violently as before.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;WAIT FOR PAPA WAIT!&rdquo; is all is heard after a few minutes by the old man, as he still stands frozen to the spot, watching the red car disappearing over the hill followed by the man still running to catch it. His finger still pointing to the left. Coming out of a trance, he blinks. Once. Twice. He strokes his well grown beard furrowing his brow pushing up his sunglasses. <br />
<br />
&ldquo;What a strange family&hellip;&rdquo;. he mutters. <br />
<br />
The words are carried away by the coming ocean breeze. The sun&rsquo;s glare is still as bright as the old man continues making his way down the road, signifying the unfolding of events for the day&hellip;<br />
<br />
<br />
****************************************************************<br />
<br />
<br />
&lsquo;Waaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!&rsquo; exclaims Yuzu as she jumps out of the car. <br />
&ldquo;Look at the ocean! It&rsquo;s beautiful isn&rsquo;t it Karin!&rdquo; shouts Yuzu holding onto her wide brimmed hat. Her dress is billowing in the light ocean breeze. Karin comes up next to Yuzu staring off at the blue blanket in front of her as far as the eye can see. <br />
&ldquo;Yeah, it&rsquo;s real nice.&rdquo; Karin says hands in her pockets of her pants. <br />
Ichigo is getting all the things out of the back of their car. As Yuzu runs out to meet the waves coming in, Karin walks across the sand, careful to avoid the passing hermit crab. Ichigo drags the picnic, towels and the beach umbrella onto the sand near the car and begins to set up camp, laying out the beach mat. Over the top of the hill, a man is struggling to catch the now parked car, panting with sweat.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;Wait for PAPA&hellip;..&rdquo; he manages to voice again as he falls flat onto the sandy beach.<br />
&ldquo;Cheh, so hopeless.&rdquo; exclaims Ichigo as he looks at his dad face down in the sand. He opens the umbrella and sits down on the beach mat they brought. <br />
&ldquo;Yay! Papa you managed to catch up!&rdquo; Yuzu happily shouts from the beach shore waving at him as she stands ankle deep in the water.Papa raises his head very slowly with a forced smile on his red face.<br />
&ldquo;Papa&rsquo;s just glad he brought you all to the beach&hellip;&rdquo; and collapses.<br />
The whole family eats their packed lunch, including Papa who is hand fed by Yuzu. The sun moved slowly across the near cloudless sky.<br />
<br />
<br />
&ldquo;Who wants ice-cream?!&rdquo; Papa shouts cheerily, now up on his feet again. <br />
&ldquo;The shop is just at the other side of the beach. Papa will go and get you all some!&rdquo; he says grinning, hands on his hips.<br />
&ldquo;I do I do!&rdquo; screams Yuzu with a giggle, hand raised.<br />
&ldquo;Do you know where the shop is for real?&rdquo; Ichigo says to his dad with a glare.<br />
&ldquo;Of Course! Papa has been here plenty of times!&rdquo; their dad says with a fist raised like a super hero and a smirk on his face. <br />
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back in no time with ice creams for everyone! Stay out of trouble now!&rdquo; he yells back at them as he runs towards the shop at the other side of the beach.<br />
As Yuzu and Karin splash in the waves, a car can be heard coming over the hill, stopping near the family&rsquo;s spot. The car doors slam. Ichigo now sitting down, looks away from his sisters over his shoulder to see who has come to join them. His eyes widen as the waves lapping sounds is replaced by a cry of horror.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;Yoohoo Ichigo!&rdquo; yells Rukia as she waves with an air of lightness and a huge smile across her face. Behind her Ichigo could see Inoue, Ishida, Tatsuki, Mizuiro Asano and Chado all in their beachwear.<br />
&ldquo;Ichigo-san!&rdquo; cries Inoue as she waves at Ichigo, her long orange hair waving in the breeze. <br />
&ldquo;Ichigo!&rdquo; cries Asano as he runs up to Ichigo tears streaming down his face, hands out, diving for Ichigo.<br />
Ichigo dodges as he jumps up letting Asano have a mouth full of sand.<br />
&ldquo;Ichigo!! How come you didn&rsquo;t tell us you were going to the beach today!&rdquo; he sobs quickly recovering from the failed greeting.<br />
&ldquo;We would have come with you! See we even brought fireworks and a barbeque! We don&rsquo;t even spend any time together outside school anymore.&rdquo; The rest of the gang had already made their way down to where Ichigo&rsquo;s family had set up their gear. Yuzu cries out from the waves:<br />
&ldquo;Ichigo, who are you talking to?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Just some friends from school Yuzu, no need to worry!&rdquo; shouts Ichigo towards where Yuzu and Karin had stopped playing temporarily to see what the commotion was about. Now turning towards his friends he asks <br />
&ldquo;Who told you I was going to the beach?&rdquo; frown forming on his already concentrated face.<br />
<br />
Asano says with a thoughtful face<br />
&ldquo;Well Rukia-san rang all of us up this morning asking if we wanted to go, so we&rsquo;re all here! We didn&rsquo;t know you were coming!&rdquo; pointing at Ichigo, other hand on hip.<br />
Rukia laughs loudly. &ldquo;Must be a total coincidence then!&rdquo; she says with a sideways glance down at the sand. <br />
&ldquo;Cheh.&rdquo; Ichigo glares at Rukia, annoyance flaring.<br />
&ldquo;Well now that we&rsquo;re here lets have lots of fun until dinner!&rdquo; Inoue says perkily with a bright smile, hands clasped, just to break up the forming tension.<br />
&ldquo;Yeah! Let&rsquo;s go swimming!&rdquo; shouts Asano as he puts his hand around Chado. <br />
&ldquo;Mm.&rdquo; is all Chado says, his face the same as ever.<br />
&ldquo;What about you Ishida! Come swimming!&rdquo; says Asano. <br />
&ldquo;No thanks, I think I&rsquo;m going to stay under the umbrella and read my book.&rdquo; Ishida says as he pushes up his glasses making the sun rays reflect off them as he does so.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon Inoue, let&rsquo;s go get changed.&rdquo; Tatsuki says, bag slung over her shoulder, signalling Inoue to follow her. <br />
&ldquo;Okay right away! Just let me grab my things!&rdquo; Inoue says as she picks up her bag.<br />
&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon Mizuiro let&rsquo;s go with them!&rdquo; Asano declares with a sly look on his face, who was immediately pummelled by Tatsuki&rsquo;s fist of fury.<br />
&ldquo;Cheh. Pervert.&rdquo; Tatsuki mutters frowning down the fallen Asano, as Mizuiro just shakes his head and sighs.<br />
As they all head towards the change rooms, Rukia grabs Ichigo&rsquo;s arm and says with glean in her eyes and another smile<br />
&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon Ichigo! Let&rsquo;s head down to the shops! I want to get an ice cream! It&rsquo;s so hot!&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Ah but-&ldquo;<br />
&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon! Time&rsquo;s wasting!&rdquo;<br />
and without any resistance Ichigo is dragged away by Rukia down the beach as Chado watches. As he sets up the rest of the things, the rest of them jump into the clear blue water as the sun continues to pass through the afternoon sky, shining down just as bright as before.<br />
<br />
*****************************************************************<br />
<br />
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the meaning of this Rukia!&rdquo;<br />
Rukia just puts her hands on her hip and grimaces. &ldquo;What are you talking about? You know your responsibilities. You&rsquo;re a shinigami. Anyways, even though a hollow appearing at the beach is a rare occasion due to the lack of people, there is still a chance it could appear at any moment.&rdquo; she quietly voices on the veranda outside the small shop.<br />
Ichigo just frowns back at her, arms folded across his chest.<br />
&ldquo;And since your family is also with you, you&rsquo;re lucky I&rsquo;m here. If one shows up they&rsquo;re done for.&rdquo; she adds looking out at the ocean, looking at the seagulls circling the lighthouse on the cliff at the other end of the beach. Rukia takes out her Hollow detector just to check. The screen stares back at her, blank as ever. Ichigo just scratches his head. <br />
&ldquo;Cheh. Just thought when I&rsquo;d get a break from this Shinigami business.&rdquo; <br />
Turning towards the shop door he says <br />
&ldquo;Well better be heading back. I&rsquo;m meant to be looking after my sisters.&rdquo; as the two walk back down the beach, Ichigo felt a prickling on the back of his neck.<br />
&ldquo;Ichigo!&rdquo; is all is heard as a flying foot was heading towards him at increasing deft speed. Just bracing for the impact, Ichigo manages to stop his dad&rsquo;s kick with his two hands and looks up at his father&rsquo;s face with a smirk.<br />
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re still too slow old man.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Ah Ichigo, I&rsquo;m glad to see that my son is fighting fit.&rdquo; His dad said holding the promised ice creams in his two hands. <br />
&ldquo;Eh? Who&rsquo;s this Ichigo?&rdquo; His dad said glancing to the right at Rukia as Ichigo takes one.<br />
&ldquo;Ah, just a friend from school.&rdquo; As Ichigo opens the ice cream wrapper and puts the popsicle in his mouth.<br />
&ldquo;Heh, don&rsquo;t be shy Ichigo, if she&rsquo;s your girlfriend just say it.&rdquo; His dad slyly whispers into his son&rsquo;s ear as he slings his arm around him, still with popsicles in hand.<br />
&ldquo;Baka, she&rsquo;s just a friend.&rdquo; Ichigo yells, ice cream in his mouth as he throws his dad over his shoulder and into the sand.<br />
&ldquo;Ahhhh! The Ice creams!&rdquo; his dad cries looking at the popsicles clutched in his two hands, still intact. <br />
&ldquo;Phew they&rsquo;re alright.&rdquo; His dad sighs with relief as the waves reach his body in the sand.<br />
<br />
As the afternoon sun set in the far west, the group of family and friends manage to pass the time with ease. The afternoon heat dissolves and is replaced with the cool evening air. At the other end of the beach, the lighthouse starts its daily duty as the chirping of crickets somehow drowned out the rest of the small groups&rsquo; worries.<br />
<br />
****************************************************************<br />
<br />
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s start cooking dinner!&rdquo; Yuzu exclaims, digging out what their family had brought for a barbeque. <br />
&ldquo;Wah, sugoi!&rdquo; Inoue says in awe as a huge chicken is pulled out by Yuzu out of their picnic basket. <br />
&ldquo;Yosha! Barbeque time!&rdquo; Asano yells, fist punching into the air.<br />
&ldquo;How about the girls take care of the food, the guys can grab us some firewood and set up the fireworks.&rdquo; Yuzu suggests happily.<br />
&ldquo;Ah, good idea, Asano, go grab us some firewood.&rdquo; Tatsuki tells the crouching boy with a hungry look in his eyes staring at the chicken.<br />
&ldquo;Ehhh?? But I was going to-&ldquo;<br />
&ldquo;Just Go!&rdquo; Tatsuki threatened rounding him with her fist.<br />
&ldquo;Hai!&rdquo; Asano screamed as he ran off up to the sand dunes.<br />
&ldquo;I better follow him and make sure he doesn&rsquo;t do anything stupid.&rdquo; Mizuiro again sighs as he walks after the running Asano.<br />
<br />
Rukia and Ichigo sit down at the shore, watching the ocean and the setting sun. <br />
&ldquo;Eh the day&rsquo;s been pretty uneventful.&rdquo; Ichigo mutters.<br />
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get your hopes up yet.&rdquo; Rukia mutters back watching the rising tide.<br />
&ldquo;The day&rsquo;s not over.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
&ldquo;Ichigo! Can you help set up the fireworks!&rdquo; Yuzu yells at them.<br />
&ldquo;Ahh.&rdquo; Ichigo yells back, standing up. As he dusts off the sand, the barbeque starts with the return of Asano carrying firewood crying, along with Mizuiro.<br />
&ldquo;I got a splinter.&rdquo; He sniffles as he drops the firewood to nurse his finger.<br />
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re such a coward.&rdquo; Tatsuki says frowning at him, hands on hips.<br />
&ldquo;Now we have firewood, we better start cooking.&rdquo; Yuza says, putting on her apron she brought along. The smell of roast meat filled the area as they settled around the fire they built earlier that day. <br />
<br />
&ldquo;Itadakimasu!&rdquo; Yuza cries cheerfully with a smile as she put down the roast chicken.<br />
&ldquo;Wah, Yuza you&rsquo;re such a good cook!&rdquo; Inoue deplores looking the food.<br />
&ldquo;Yeah Yuza, you should teach Inoue sometime how to make proper food.&rdquo; Tatsuki says sitting down.<br />
&ldquo;What do you mean Tatsuki-chan!&rdquo; Inoue cries. &ldquo;My food&rsquo;s just fine! Having bread with ham and peanut butter is good!&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;See, weird things again.&rdquo; Tatsuki says with a roll of the eyes and a frown.<br />
&ldquo;Well let&rsquo;s all start! Everyone grab a plate and dig in!&rdquo; Yuza says bringing out the plates and cutlery.<br />
&ldquo;Thanks for cooking Yuza. Itadakimasu!&rdquo; Ichigo says as he opens his mouth ready to bite into the roasted chicken. <br />
&ldquo;Ichigo! I forgot my towel I left down at the other end of the beach! Can you help me!&rdquo; Rukia yells as she grabs him by the shirt and starts dragging him away.<br />
&ldquo;Ehh! But I&rsquo;m eati-&ldquo;<br />
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too dark so I need help! Be right back you guys!&rdquo; Rukia says to the rest of them with a wave as Ichigo&rsquo;s chicken in his hand drops his plate onto the beach mat.<br />
<br />
****************************************************************<br />
&ldquo;Rukia! What the! I was just starting to-&ldquo;<br />
&ldquo;Look&rdquo;. She says, taking out her hollow detector as they both run down the beach. Clearly on the before black green screen, a clear white dot was blinking, it&rsquo;s pulse on the dark green screen signifying trouble.<br />
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not far off, in the direction of the lighthouse. We better hurry if you want to finish your dinner.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Cheh.&rdquo; is all Ichigo has to say a piercing hollow&rsquo;s scream cuts into the darkening sky, with the moon glowing eerily back at the two figures running up the rising cliff.<br />
<br />
***************************************************************<br />
<br />
The moon lights the evening sky, reflecting the hollow&rsquo;s foreboding shadow onto the cliffs it stands under. With a piercing cry, it leaps, jumping onto the cliff where the lighthouse stands. Its five heads writhe in all directions looking for the reiatsu it has felt pulsing all day.<br />
&ldquo;Food&hellip;&rdquo; one head echoes as the rest of the heads pierce the sky with another cry of hunger. It rises on his hind legs and falls, sending shockwaves through the cliff, as Ichigo and Rukia reach the lighthouse eyes widening at the sheer size of the creature.<br />
&ldquo;Yosha.&rdquo; Ichigo yells as he pops what seems like a lolly into his mouth. As his body jumps out of the way, now with Kon in it, Ichigo assumes his guard position, raising his mammoth blade in full Shinigami glory.<br />
&ldquo;Kon, get to somewhere safe.&rdquo; he shouts to his body, which gives him a salute and a wink, leaping away.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;Be careful Ichigo. I&rsquo;ve never seen a Hollow with five heads, all wearing masks before.&rdquo; Rukia says in warning.<br />
&ldquo;No problem Rukia. I&rsquo;ll finish this off quickly.&rdquo; Ichigo smirks as he prepares to attack.<br />
&ldquo;Yoh! Hollow. Am I what you&rsquo;re looking for?!&rdquo; Ichigo yells at the five heads writhing in the starry night sky. The hollow lets out another cold cry in return.<br />
&ldquo;Well since you&rsquo;ve taken me away from my dinner, you&rsquo;ve pissed me off.&rdquo; Ichigo shouts preparing to attack,<br />
&ldquo;I think its reason enough for me to send you up to Soul Society.&rdquo; He yells as he leaps off the ground, attacking with full force, flashing his zanpaktou, raised to the rising pale moon.<br />
<br />
The five heads flew like lightning towards the leaping figure trying to snap at the Shinigami flying through the air, blade flashing in the moonlight. <br />
&ldquo;Orrreeyahhh!&rdquo; Ichigo cries as he counters one of the heads with a flying kick while he swings his zanpaktou down hard on one of the heads. The hollow fills the area with another cry as the blade slices clean through. The head hits the ground with a deafening thud, writhing like a snake in fury. The rest of the heads raise their heads to the moon and scream in a chaotic frenzy.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;Ehh! Putting up such a weak fight! Just as I thought.&rdquo; Ichigo says as his feet touch the ground. <br />
&ldquo;Ichigo! Watch out!&rdquo; Rukia shouts as the other four heads dive towards him, their mouths dripping with drool, eyes full of rage.<br />
&ldquo;Cheh, Too slow.&rdquo; Ichigo mutters as he leaps to dodge the coming attack. His eyes widen as two of the heads change direction and head straight at him in the air. He dodges to the left as he swings at one of the heads, severing it from its body. Green ooze is dripping from the writhing neck from which the head fell from. <br />
&ldquo;Two down, three to go.&rdquo; Ichigo says as he prepares to attack again.<br />
&ldquo;Wait! Ichigo! Look at it!&rdquo; Rukia cries in alarm.<br />
&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Ichigo yells back with an eyebrow raised.<br />
The fallen heads had disappeared, leaving only green blood on the grass patched ground. But that wasn&rsquo;t the problem. The hollow had started to pierce the sky with it&rsquo;s ear-splitting screams. The place where the two heads had been, started to convulse violently.<br />
&ldquo;What the-&ldquo; is all Ichigo says, eyes widening as two new heads shot out of the body, replacing the ones cut off before. The two new heads send a chilling cry through the air, followed by the others.<br />
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s with this hollow!&rdquo; Ichigo mutters, teeth clenched, brow furrowing deeper, tightening his hands around the hilt of his blade, deepening his stance. Launching his attack again, Ichigo&rsquo;s blade struck one of the original heads, cutting deep into its rotting flesh, sending green ooze flying from its body. <br />
&ldquo;Damn it, why the hell won&rsquo;t it die.&rdquo; Ichigo yells in frustration as he lands, panting, sweat beads glistening on his brow. The hollow cries out as it convulses again, another head forming to take the place of the one gone.<br />
&ldquo;Ichigo! Watch out!&rdquo; Rukia screams at him.<br />
The hollow had raised itself on its hindlegs, revealing a horde of writhing tentacles that came after Ichigo at soaring speed. Just dodging, Ichigo slid to the left sending a cloud of dust and gravel through the air. Now trying to avoid the tentacles, Ichigo counters, slicing his blade in a full arc, shearing all the tentacles flying towards him, spraying the writhing worms in a full circle. One of the hollow&rsquo;s heads comes flying at him, it beak letting out a furious howl grabbing Ichigo around the waist, clamping down tight. Ichigo winces at the splitting pain.<br />
&ldquo;Shit!&rdquo; Ichigo grumbles as he&rsquo;s lifted high into the air by the head. <br />
&ldquo;Ichigo!&rdquo; Rukia yells as the head throws his body down hard onto the ground, sending sand flying everywhere. <br />
&ldquo;Damnit.&rdquo; Ichigo exclaims as he gets up slowly, resting his pounded body on his blade stuck in the ground. He clutches the hilt, like a lifeline. A thin red ribbon had started to flow down his forehead, staining his blurred vision from the fall.<br />
&ldquo;What do I do now&hellip;&rdquo; he mutters as the hollow writhing tentacles start to regenerate. <br />
&ldquo;Rukia what&rsquo;s with this hollow!&rdquo; he yells at Rukia, standing at a fair distance from the fight.<br />
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know! It should be dead by now!&rdquo; Rukia shouts back, with a look of panic in her eyes.<br />
&ldquo;What do we do&hellip;&rdquo; she whispers as the hollow cries, sending a flood of terror down her spine as she clenches her fist, shaking.<br />
<br />
**************************************************************<br />
<br />
&ldquo;What do we do&hellip;&rdquo; Rukia whispers to herself and to the night sky. The hollow returns her question with a howl. But it was not the only one.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;Oi! Rukia-sannnn!&rdquo; shouts a familiar voice breaking the tension radiating from the fight.<br />
&ldquo;Eh?!&rdquo; Rukia sounds shockingly as she looked towards the lighthouse.<br />
Standing at the top was a man carrying a cane, waving at her from under his striped green and white hat, wearing wooden sandals. Standing there was Uruhara Kisuke, smiling at the both of them, with Jinta and Ururu watching the fight happening right under their noses.<br />
&ldquo;Cheh. He&rsquo;s hopeless.&rdquo; Jinta mutters, folding his arms frowning down at Ichigo&rsquo;s broken figure. Ururu was just staring down at the hollow and Ichigo with her puppy eyes, hands gripped to the railing.<br />
&ldquo;Uruhara?!&rdquo; Rukia exclaims.<br />
&ldquo;Sandle hat guy!?!?! What are you doing here!?&rdquo; Ichigo shouts in a tone of shock, brow still furrowed as he turned to face the direction of the greeting.<br />
&ldquo;Eh! We&rsquo;re just here on a short holiday while I look after this lighthouse! Oi, Kurosaki-kun! Watch out!&rdquo; Uruhara yells as he points at the hollow coming at Ichigo with his cane.<br />
&ldquo;Damnit.&rdquo; Ichigo grimaces as he dodges, running and slicing at the coming brown tentacles that were aiming straight for him.<br />
Uruhara again shouts down &ldquo;Kurosaki-kun! You better kill it soon! Otherwise-&ldquo;<br />
&ldquo;I know Sandle-hat dude! But how do I kill it!&rdquo; Ichigo yells back angrily in response.<br />
&ldquo; Eh? Didn&rsquo;t you notice? On its belly.&rdquo; Uruhara says in his lilting voice.<br />
&ldquo;What?!&rdquo; Ichigo shouts as he dodges a head and slides backwards, eyes focusing on the hollow&rsquo;s abdomen. <br />
Rukia gasps.<br />
Ichigo&rsquo;s eyes widen as among the brown writhing tentacles, he saw what Uruhara was talking about for a split second.<br />
<br />
A hollow mask.<br />
<br />
***************************************************************<br />
<br />
&ldquo;Heh.&rdquo; <br />
Ichigo smirks as he readies himself, blade raised to the sky. <br />
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve wasted enough of my time.&rdquo; He shouts running head on with the hollow. Dodging two heads, he slices at one another, making the hollow rear back howling. Landing on the ground, Ichigo runs towards the hollow mask in the middle of the hollow&rsquo;s unguarded abdomen, ready to slice it into two. Shearing away at the tentacles coming towards him at towering speed, with a loud cry Ichigo charged at the mask, placing his blade squarely in the centre, carving the mask into two. With a chilling shriek the hollow raised its&rsquo; heads to the sky as it starts to disintegrate into the cool evening air, letting the moons&rsquo; rays fall on the ground it once stood. Ichigo collapses, trying to catch his breath. His blade gleams as he thrust his zanpaktou into the sandy ground.<br />
&ldquo;Well done Kurosaki-kun!&rdquo; Urahara yells down at the small figure, lifting up his striped hat to see the crouched shinigami better in the dim moonlight.<br />
&ldquo;Ichigo! Are you alright?&rdquo; Rukia cries, running up to him. He raises his head and looks up at her with a smile. <br />
&ldquo;No problem right.&rdquo; He says. <br />
Rukia smiles back with relief.<br />
&ldquo;Cheh. We better head back now, the others must be getting worried.&rdquo; Ichigo says after a second getting up with the help of his zanpaktou.<br />
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;d Kon get to? I need my body back.&rdquo; Ichigo asks as he saw no other figure on the grass patched cliff.<br />
<br />
Cries could be heard from a small campfire other than their own.<br />
Looking down, Kon was in Ichigo&rsquo;s body, can in hand, laughing his head off with four unknown girls that were having their own private beach party.<br />
&ldquo;Koooonnnnn!&rdquo; Ichigo yells in fury as he takes off running down the slope at full speed, anger fueling his sudden burst of energy. <br />
&ldquo;Ichigo!&rdquo; Rukia starts running after him.<br />
Kon hearing the cry of anger from where he was, jumps up from where he is and takes off down the beach, with a goodbye wave to the surprised girls expressions.<br />
&ldquo;Kon!! Come back here!!&rdquo; Ichigo yells at the figure running ahead with his body. Kon just waves back at him, still running away from his chaser. Not far behind Rukia followed the two, pausing to look up at the pale moon in the clear evening sky.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
**************************************************************<br />
<br />
A loud bang went off as bright yellow sparks filled in the night sky, reflecting in the deep blue mirror beneath it. <br />
&ldquo;Wow that was a good one Chado, light another!&rdquo; Asano says as he stares up at the sky, standing next to the looming figure of his friend, Mizuiro sitting beside the two. <br />
&ldquo;Eh? Hey look! there they are!&rdquo; Asano said pointing to the approaching couple then went off to find a lost towel.<br />
&ldquo;Where have you two been? You were gone for ages! Your food&rsquo;s all cold!&rdquo; Yuzu scolded as she pouts at the two, hands on hips.<br />
&ldquo;Looking for the towel like we said, I think the waves washed it away though.&rdquo; says Ichigo as he sat down and grabbed his plate of food he left, now cold. Biting into a piece of chicken, he met Ishida&rsquo;s eyes with a brow raised.<br />
&ldquo;What? Can&rsquo;t help it if it got washed away.&rdquo; He says again, opening a can of soft drink.<br />
&ldquo;Look Karin! Papa&rsquo;s gonna light a firework!&rdquo; Ichigo&rsquo;s dad says as he lit a match and lit the line. Karin still didn&rsquo;t take any notice. It sailed into the sky, and burst into stars of green and pink.<br />
<br />
Now sitting next to Ichigo, Rukia stares up at the disappearing lights exploding like sunflowers opening to the rising sun.<br />
&ldquo;It was a fused hollow. Uruhara told me as you chased Kon down the beach. I&rsquo;ve never encountered one so I didn&rsquo;t know why it wouldn&rsquo;t die. Instead of the hollow having one soul, it had many lost souls fused together all governed under one mask. The heads were just decoys. The souls most likely died in some shipwreck altogether, lost out at sea and came in attracted by your reiatsu.&rdquo; Rukia says quietly after a few minutes.<br />
She side-glances at Ichigo, who was taking a long sip out his can. He was staring at the fireworks still blossoming in the darkness, listening to the screams and yelps coming from the place the fireworks were being set off.<br />
&ldquo;Lucky you were here eh?&rdquo; Ichigo mutters after a few seconds. <br />
Rukia glances at him again, trying to read his face. <br />
A small smile had somehow crept across his mouth as he blinks and sighs loudly in exhaustion.<br />
&ldquo;Mm.&rdquo; Rukia replies, now clutching her knees tighter to her chest as a loud explosion echoes around the beach and more lights fill the night sky. Her dress hem brushes the sand as a light breeze passes by the sitting youngsters, carrying the laughter heard around the small bonfire up to the stars. The sound of the crashing waves telling those that could hear: another ending to another summer&rsquo;s day.<br />
