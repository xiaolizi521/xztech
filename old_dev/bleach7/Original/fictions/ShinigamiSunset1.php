I did not build this sandbox.  Tite Kubo did, constructing it out of the best possible materials.  I have taken the liberty of using it for my own purposes; I believe I have returned all of his possessions the way I found them, none the worse for wear.  Hopefully.<br />

Any errors, misspellings or mistakes in the use of the romaji rendering of Japanese terms is entirely my fault. If the story sucks, well, hey... thanks for your time.<br />

1. Karakura Town at the death of the day<br />
<br />
Brilliant orange – red, the sun dropped through the final cloud – scudded course of its circuit, daubing pungent color on the pale flanks and shoulders of the structures forming the city’s broken skyline, igniting the holes of their high windows, forming echelons of glaring, blazing eyes.<br />
<br />
A fiery tableau above. And below, a murder of unfurling shadow.<br />
<br />
Ichigo Kurosaki leapt up from the darkness between buildings and into the dwindling light, shredded shihakusho flapping and the tattered banner of Zangetsu’s sheath- wrapper whipping jagged in trail, describing his ascent.  Zangetsu, soul cutter, held low and to the right in one rawboned hand; even as the Soul Reaper rose, his wrist rotated and cocked to bring the edge of the black and silver blade in line with his enemy.<br />
<br />
The sunlight struck his face as a blinding circle of light.  That was unexpected, and in reflex his spirit – eyes squinted. His lips stretched into a grin.  Fresh rivulets of blood flowed along the congealing red pathways etched onto his skin.  His grin widened.<br />
<br />
A predatory shape in spread silhouette dropped impossibly fast towards him. Framed by the sun’s burning disk, seemingly fire – filled with ruddy light glowing through the hole where a soul had once been seated, gleaming from ragged claws and jagged eyes, it fell.  Hollow. A hateful screeching yowl carried to Ichigo’s spirit – ears through what passed for wind in the marginalized plane an eyelash from normal human perception. Razor fingers stretching in menace, the crusty rows of oversized shark – teeth in his enemy’s misshapen head leaked a yellow tinged and viscous liquid that sloughed off into the passing air, forming twin poisonous contrails that imprisoned rays from the dying sun and glowed like oblate bits of amber.<br />
<br />
The sun was unexpected, but the hollow’s fall brought it now into the shadows with him, under the cowl of the high- rises.  A last beam leaked through the soul- hole and splashed around the blood- flecked curve of Ichigo’s mouth.<br />
<br />
His eyes glowed up from the dark with a fire entirely their own.<br />
<br />
Below, people walked and ran and carried on their business.  Below, cars bumbled through the evening rush hour, the heart of the commute marked by the numbing cycle of the stop- lights.  Below, bulbs flickered on like sudden thoughts amidst the stunted trees, above the gray and grimy asphalt and in the street – facing shop windows.<br />
<br />
Above, the black shape of a helicopter, striped with final lashes from the daystar, swept in orbit above the darkling Karakura byways.  Above even that, the long inkblot of a jet pissed white ropes behind it as it nosed through rosy cotton towards some unknown destination.<br />
<br />
Zangetsu swung upwards, so fast to seem a solid midnight arc, edge a gleaming sickle moon.<br />
<br />
The hollow, imbued with shield- like extrusions on its four forearms, moved to block the sword strike.  The soul cutter impacted with a muffled cracking sound that in no way indicated the fury of the kiri age, slicing and shattering the lower left arm of the creature.  Cracks appeared across the white – gray armor of the hollow on the flank beneath the damaged arm, even as the transferred energy knocked it sideways.  Keening, it ripped with foot - long claws at the shinigami, using three arms and two stumpy legs, unmindful of its tumbling state or the new trajectory that carried it away from him, towards the side of an office building nearby.<br />
<br />
The soul – sensitive individuals in the milling thousands below found themselves gazing upwards into the gloaming for no reason they could fathom, echoes of silent thunder fading to their puzzled minds.<br />
<br />
Ichigo, allowing the momentum of his attack to effect him, pivoted his hips and landed on a ledge extending from the side of the building behind.  His grin melted into a frown, the line deepening between his eyes as he tracked the hollow’s path towards the bluff exterior of the structure opposite, hundreds of souls in offices abutting the exterior wall plain to his senses.<br />
<br />
Seconds to impact.<br />
<br />
“Yo! Orahime!!” He made his voice carry across the distance to the two figures he couldn’t see, that he knew were there. He did not intend for the high and desperate timbre his concern injected to turn his cry into a plea.  But, it did.<br />
