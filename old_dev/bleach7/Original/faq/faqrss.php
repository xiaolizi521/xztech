<b>Q. What is an RSS?</b><br />
<br />
An RSS feed is an internet data file called an XML file.  Think of these as user defined web database files (similar to Microsoft Access but in a Web language format).  If you open up the file directly in either Firefox, IE6, or Safari, it would show up as a list of items, most times in a "tree format" (think of how Windows Explorer shows your folders and files).  When paired with a program that understands the wording of the file, it can generate different looks for a user to read news items.  Most internet news sites and many blogs support RSS feed to help readers know when a new item has been posted.<br />
<br />
<b>Q. Why should I use RSS?</b><br />
<br />
RSS allows you to retrieve news items that have been released, without having to go to the actual website. So if you have lots of site you like to regularly check, RSS allows you to have all the latest news in one place.  It also helps with the bandwidth for the site, because you are only requesting one file, instead of the many files that make up a website (ie. access to the database, webpages, images, etc).<br />
<br />
