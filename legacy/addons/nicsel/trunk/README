DEBIAN-12
UBUNTU-1

There is a long standing issue where Debian and Ubuntu have required DCO
to manually select a NIC during provisioning. This is frustrating for 
DCO as well as time consuming. This also holds potential as it can
cause a Rapid Reload to sit stalled for many days, if not caught by
a member of DCO as the customer will never know or be able to perform the
NIC selection on their own.

Resolution to this issue is a two fold process.

1) Add ipapppend 2 to the PXE target file for the kick
2) Add S31nicsel to /lib/deb-installer-startup.d within the initrd.gz

Instructions to complete (2) are as follows:

The file we will be working with is initrd.gz. This file is stored in our
TFTP directory, organized by OS and version. The example I will work with, 
will be debian lenny.

The directory is /tftpboot/pxe/debian/lenny. This directory is divided by 
architecture, so please remember to do this for both. We will work on 64bit.

1) Back up the initrd.
2) Make a working directory. (mkdir lenny-initrd-amd64)
3) Move into the working directory.
4) Perform the following command:
gunzip -c <path.to.initrd.gz> | cpio -id

If you now look at the directory, you'll see what looks like a linux 
root directory tree.

Copy the script S31nicsel into the directory "/lib/deb-installer-startup.d" 
and make it executable.

Once this is done, you need to repack the initrd.

5) Move back to the top of the working directory.
6) Perform the following command:
find . | cpio --create --format='newc' | gzip > ../initrd.gz.new

Note: This does not overwrite the old one.

If you are satisfied that you did everything correctly, move the file into place. 

Make sure the permissions are set correctly by executing the following command:

chmod --reference=<backup.initrd> initrd.gz

**********************

Description of Fix:

Adding 'ipappend 2' to the host's pxelinux config file makes PXELINUX
append the mac address of that interface to the kernel options.
* http://syslinux.zytor.com/wiki/index.php/SYSLINUXIPAPPEND_flag_val_.5BPXELINUX_only.5D

This allows the initrd to access to the mac address of the interface
which PXE booted and is probably the interface we want to use for DHCP.

Executing from the debian-installer-startup.d directory of the initrd,
this script reads the value of the 'BOOTIF' kernel option and looks
to see if there is an interface name with this mac address.
If so, it then uses 'db_set' to change the 'netcfg/choose_interface'
option to this interface name.

Example /var/lib/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/default:
LABEL install
 kernel hardy-amd64
 ipappend 2
 append interface=auto [the rest of your options]
