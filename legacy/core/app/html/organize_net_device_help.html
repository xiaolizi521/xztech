  This page shows all of the devices in the current account.
</p>
<p align="justify">
  Devices on the top row of the diagram are not behind any other devices in the account. An arrow from device A to 
  device B indicates that device B is behind device A. Multiple arrows pointing to a single device indicate that the
  device is behind multiple devices.
</p>
<p align="justify">
  Devices that are behind the same set of "parent" devices are grouped together within a box-outline. This box will have 
  one set of arrows pointing to the middle device in the group, but the relationship that set of arrows signifies 
  applies to all of the devices within that box.
</p>
<p align="justify">
  To see more information about a particular device, hover over that device in the diagram.
