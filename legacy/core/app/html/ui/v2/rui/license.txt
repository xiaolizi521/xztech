Some extensions rely on code from other sources, which 
was included with the code:

The code for certain type detecting functions was taken from 
Douglas Crockford's website <javascript.crockford.com>.

The code for certain extensions to the Array object was taken 
from the Mozilla Developer Center <developer.mozilla.org> and
