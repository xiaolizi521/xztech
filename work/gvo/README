GVO Git Development Tree

Primary Author: Adam Hubscher

Purpose:

This is the location where I will mainly keep my development files
for GVO. As time goes on and others come to use it, it will become centralized.

This repository is to house all automation scripts that will be used throughout
the progression of bringing GVO's datacenter techologies further into the future.

Current Projects:

Backup Inventory, Auditing & Automation
Firewall Development for All Servers
