This is the basic startup module of an Example42 Puppet infrastructure.

Use as reference, and customize as you prefer.

The organization of logic and files can be adapted to own needs.
Generally this "startup" module defines:
- Environments ($env), such as: devel, test, prod ...
- Zones ($zone), such as dmz1, dmz2, management ...
- Roles ($role), such as syslog, webserver, loadbalancer ...
- Nodes for the single hosts.



The logic of how to assemble and organize these groups is defined in this project module, where you can define relevant variables for the various modules (one for application, generally) imported.
