README: Kickstart Taskfile

Description:
This file describes the contents of this directory and how it is used in the ServerBeach
Kickstart system.  Its intent is to give the developer and system administrator a guide
into the SBRescue processing through the execution of Taskfiles.

A note about the taskfile system used by the Server Beach Provisioning System:
Taskfiles are a collection of BASH scripts that are loaded local to a server through SBRescue and are 
used for the automatic registration, burnin, audit, wipe, and provisioning of servers.  Specifically, 
the task file system is only used during intial server recognition, maintainance and provisioning of both
Debian and Windows 2003 based server installs.

As a system, the taskfiles are all driven by a custom ServerBeach Debian Image that runs in a RAM Disk setup 
called SBRescue.  SBRescue itself loads and runs in through the PXE system.  Once SBRescue 
is loaded into RAM, depending on the status that a particular server system is in, the corresponding taskfile is 
called and executed to perform its given task.  This is why by convention taskfiles are named <TASKNAME>.txt.

The following information attempts to give a high-level description about the functions that each indvidual taskfile
servers in the provisioning process.

default.txt - The default.txt script is the very first script that gets called by the SBRescue Image upon the initial 
introduction of a NEW server into the SB Provisioning system.  

Now in order to understand how this script is called it is important to understand the conditions necessary for this script 
to caled and execute. For this, it is worth noting that the ServerBeach Provisioning system is 
comoposed of many components working in tandem for provisioning.  By default, the system operates it provisioning through 
as server system called Kickstart. Kickstart itself is a term coined by RedHat in using thier automated Anaconda based 
provisioning system; Serverbeach does use this system as well (specifically for RH/CentOs/Fedora based installs) 
but in the context of the SB Provisioning sytem as whole, it is meant to describe a portion of the SB provisioning system 
that is used to specifically automate the registration, maintaince, and provision for customer servers. 

Background: (SB Automation System Components)
The following describes the major components that comprise the complete SB Systems.


Kickstart Service Components:
The SB Kickstart System is composed of the following components:
    -A DHCP Server
    -A TFTPd Server
    -A SB custom  Kickstart Postgres Database Instance
    -A samba server 
    -An Apache server
    -Cgi Scripts
    -Custom Perl ServerBeach Library Functions.
    -Custom Bash ServerBeach Library Functions.
