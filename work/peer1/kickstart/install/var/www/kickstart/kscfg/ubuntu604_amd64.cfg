#### Contents of the preconfiguration file
### Localization
# Locale sets language and country.
#d-i debian-installer/locale string en_US

# Keyboard selection.
#d-i console-tools/archs select at
#d-i console-keymaps-at/keymap select us
# Example for a different keyboard architecture
#d-i console-keymaps-usb/keymap select mac-usb-us

### Network configuration
# netcfg will choose an interface that has link if possible. This makes it
# skip displaying a list if there is more than one interface.
#d-i netcfg/choose_interface select auto

# To pick a particular interface instead:
d-i netcfg/choose_interface select auto

# If you have a slow dhcp server and the installer times out waiting for
# it, this might be useful.
#d-i netcfg/dhcp_timeout string 60

# Any hostname and domain names assigned from dhcp take precedence over
# values set here. However, setting the values still prevents the questions
# from being shown, even if values come from dhcp.
#d-i netcfg/get_hostname string unassigned-hostname
#d-i netcfg/get_domain string unassigned-domain

# Disable that annoying WEP key dialog.
d-i netcfg/wireless_wep string
# The wacky dhcp hostname that some ISPs use as a password of sorts.
#d-i netcfg/dhcp_hostname string radish

### Mirror settings
# If you select ftp, the mirror/country string does not need to be set.
#d-i mirror/protocol string ftp
#d-i mirror/country string enter information manually
d-i mirror/http/hostname string archive.ubuntu.com
d-i mirror/http/directory string /ubuntu

# Suite to install.
d-i mirror/suite string edgy
# Suite to use for loading installer components (optional).
#d-i mirror/udeb/suite string testing

### Partitioning
# If the system has free space you can choose to only partition that space.
# Note: this must be preseeded with a localized (translated) value.
#d-i partman-auto/init_automatically_partition \
#      select Guided - use the largest continuous free space

# Alternatively, you can specify a disk to partition. The device name
# can be given in either devfs or traditional non-devfs format.
# For example, to use the first disk:
#d-i partman-auto/disk string /dev/discs/disc0/disc
d-i partman-auto/disk string /dev/?da
# In addition, you'll need to specify the method to use.
# The presently available methods are: "regular", "lvm" and "crypto"
d-i partman-auto/method string regular

# If one of the disks that are going to be automatically partitioned
# contains an old LVM configuration, the user will normally receive a
# warning. This can be preseeded away...
d-i partman-auto/purge_lvm_from_device boolean true
# And the same goes for the confirmation to write the lvm partitions.
d-i partman-lvm/confirm boolean true

# You can choose from any of the predefined partitioning recipes.
# Note: this must be preseeded with a localized (translated) value.
#d-i partman-auto/choose_recipe \
#       select All files in one partition (recommended for new users)
#d-i partman-auto/choose_recipe \
#       select Separate /home partition
#d-i partman-auto/choose_recipe \
#       select Separate /home, /usr, /var, and /tmp partitions
#d-i  partman-auto/choose_recipe         select \
#     All files in one partition (recommended for new users)

# If not, you can put an entire recipe into the preconfiguration file in one
# (logical) line. This example creates a small /boot partition, suitable
# swap, and uses the rest of the space for the root partition:

# Notes on config below
#   First number is minimun size of partition (75 MB for example)
#   Second number is priority 
#       After all the minimum partition sizes
#   Third is maximum size
#       This is set really large to designate all left over space
#       The percentage (300%) is relative to amount of RAM (300% of 1GB = 3GB)

### Base system installation
d-i     base-installer/kernel/override-image    string linux-server

# This is fairly safe to set, it makes grub install automatically to the MBR
# if no other operating system is detected on the machine.
d-i grub-installer/only_debian boolean true

# This one makes grub-installer install to the MBR if it also finds some other
# OS, which is less safe as it might not be able to boot that other OS.

### Package selection

### Finishing up the first stage install
# Avoid that last message about the install being complete.
#d-i finish-install/reboot_in_progress note

### Preseeding other packages
# Depending on what software you choose to install, or if things go wrong
# during the installation process, it's possible that other questions may
# be asked. You can preseed those too, of course. To get a list of every
# possible question that could be asked during an install, do an
# installation, and then run these commands:
#   debconf-get-selections --installer > file
#   debconf-get-selections >> file

### Apt setup
# You can choose to install non-free and contrib software.
d-i apt-setup/restricted boolean true
d-i apt-setup/universe boolean true
# Uncomment this if you don't want to use a network mirror.
#d-i apt-setup/use_mirror boolean false
# Uncomment this to avoid adding security sources, or
# add a hostname to use a different server than security.debian.org.
#d-i apt-setup/security_host string

#### Advanced options
### Running custom commands during the installation
# d-i preseeding is inherently not secure. Nothing in the installer checks
# for attempts at buffer overflows or other exploits of the values of a
# preconfiguration file like this one. Only use preconfiguration files from
# trusted locations! To drive that home, and because it's generally useful,
# here's a way to run any shell command you'd like inside the installer,
# automatically.

# This first command is run as early as possible, just after
# preseeding is read.
#d-i preseed/early_command string anna-install some-udeb

# This command is run just before the install finishes, but when there is
# still a usable /target directory. You can chroot to /target and use it
# directly, or use the apt-install and in-target commands to easily install
# packages and run commands in the target system.

# From what I have seen, the late_command string needs to be on one line. Spanning
# multiple lines (even if using a \ to denote a continued line) causes a parsing error
# from the installer.  Also, specifying multiple late_command line results in only that last one
# being executed.

d-i preseed/late_command string wget -O /target/tmp/postinstall.txt http://@@KSIPADDR@@/kickstart/postconf/ubuntu/postinstall.txt ; mount -t proc proc /target/proc ; chmod +x /target/tmp/postinstall.txt ; chroot /target /tmp/postinstall.txt @@KSIPADDR@@ @@KSDOMAIN@@;
