README: Kickstart cgi-bin

Description:
This file describes the contents of this directory and how it is used in the ServerBeach
Kickstart provisioning system.  Its intent is to give the developer and system administrator a guide
into the SB Provisioning process.

The cgi-bin directory is a collection of perl cgi-scripts that run from apache on the kickstart server.
Most of these scripts handle particular functions within the provisioning sytem; some of them are used
to directly launch a kickstart (anaconda) process, while others are used to update the kickstart database
or retrieve certain provisioning information for the database.

Below is a file list of these scripts and each attempts to explain its high level function within the system.

Please note a few operating assumptions about the information below:
        - This is a working document, any information that is glean by work, additions, or enhancements
          to the system should be noted here for other developers and sys admins to know.
        - The following scripts usually indentify a server by its MAC address so any work done to these
          script should be under this assumption. 

AuditFail.cgi -     lists all servers that have failed audit and the reason why

BurninFail.cgi -    lists all servers that have failed burnin and the reason why

getErrorMessages.cgi -

holding.cgi -

ks.cgi -        this script is the primary script that is called directly from the pxe image for all Red Hat
                based kicks (RHBK). It servers as the launch point from which a RHBK locates pre, during, and post
                configuration information.

                This script will then write a file that will contain all the customer variable information that the 
                provisioning system needs to set up a server.  The information contained in this file will feed pre and
                post processing scripts that set up a customer server.

post_hardware.cgi -     this script is ued to post the hardware information up to ocean database once a server
                        has completed auditing. 

preseed.cgi -   this script is functionally similar to ks.cgi.  It is responsible for passing the preseed
                information to Debian based installs.

RapidRebootStatus.cgi -

rebootByLoc.cgi -

reboot.cgi-

register.cgi -  this script is primarily used to track the status of a server during its process. Please 
                note that the status is passed as an input to this script.

RemoteRescueTest.cgi -

status.cgi -

taskfile.cgi -  this script is used to select and write out the proper taskfile that is used by the sytem.

unattend.cgi -  this is script is Window specific in that it is used to selec the proper windows unattend
                file for provisioning.

                once this script has been assesed in more detail.
