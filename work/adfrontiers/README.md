of impressions. By contract we provide sysadmin and additional support to them.

This Github

This github is for the scripts that I create for the adfrontiers project. These are not commissioned
development projects, these are simply scripts that I write to get the job done.

In some cases they may be commissioned. If that is the case, they will note so within comments.

Current Project Participants are:

1.    **Adam Hubscher (Engineer & DBA)**
2.    **Jon Erdman (Lead DBA/DBD)**

Others may join at a later date.
