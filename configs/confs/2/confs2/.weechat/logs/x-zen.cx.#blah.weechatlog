2009 Apr 07 14:15:09  <OffbeatAdam> you're trying to install pear modules
2009 Apr 07 14:15:21  <OffbeatAdam> what are you guys using in pear
2009 Apr 07 14:15:27  <OffbeatAdam> because thats something that is root, not you
2009 Apr 07 14:15:57  <jackyyll> So i put dd-wrt on my router today
2009 Apr 07 14:16:17  <jackyyll> seems to have gone well this time
2009 Apr 07 14:19:23  <OffbeatAdam> i hate dd-wrt
2009 Apr 07 14:20:00  <jackyyll> why's that?
2009 Apr 07 14:21:05  <OffbeatAdam> brb
2009 Apr 07 15:06:31  <jackyyll> hey adam, can you nmap -sV 68.116.166.135 for me ( my ip )
2009 Apr 07 15:06:36  <jackyyll> wanna see what's open to the outside world

2009 Apr 07 16:27:05  <OffbeatAdam> its blocked
2009 Apr 07 16:27:52  <anpan> ~OffbeatAdam  what are you guys using in pear <- zip, rar, and uploadprogressbar

2009 Apr 07 16:29:06  <OffbeatAdam> we'll do that once its set up
2009 Apr 07 16:29:39  <OffbeatAdam> why don't you guys just include those pear packages within your script environment?
2009 Apr 07 16:29:45  <OffbeatAdam> you'll never actually find those installed on any system
2009 Apr 07 16:29:53  <OffbeatAdam> or, rarely will
2009 Apr 07 16:29:59  <anpan> how do you do that?
2009 Apr 07 16:30:00  <OffbeatAdam> its much better to include them locally than depend on the server
2009 Apr 07 16:32:30  <OffbeatAdam> ahh
2009 Apr 07 16:32:30  <OffbeatAdam> ew
2009 Apr 07 16:32:34  <OffbeatAdam> you guys are using dynamic libs

2009 Apr 07 16:33:08  <OffbeatAdam> lol
2009 Apr 07 16:33:15  <OffbeatAdam> they're binary extensions to php
2009 Apr 07 16:33:20  <OffbeatAdam> they're annoying
2009 Apr 07 16:33:22  <OffbeatAdam> and people like me hate them.
2009 Apr 07 16:33:40  <anpan> so what's a better thing to use?
2009 Apr 07 16:34:17  <OffbeatAdam> well
2009 Apr 07 16:34:19  <OffbeatAdam> zip and rar
2009 Apr 07 16:34:23  <OffbeatAdam> can be handled console levle
2009 Apr 07 16:34:28  <OffbeatAdam> using the system() function

2009 Apr 07 21:06:41  <OffbeatAdam> yea
2009 Apr 07 21:06:42  <OffbeatAdam> ultimately
2009 Apr 07 21:06:59  <OffbeatAdam> he was also appointed to a government position
2009 Apr 07 21:07:02  <OffbeatAdam> means he couldn't act anymore
2009 Apr 07 21:07:07  <OffbeatAdam> so it was expected to be written out

2009 Apr 07 21:28:50  <OffbeatAdam> i can tell that they wrote it fast
2009 Apr 07 21:28:53  <OffbeatAdam> and that it was acted fast
2009 Apr 07 21:29:00  <OffbeatAdam> but, ultimately that it was not fully planned out for the future.
2009 Apr 07 21:29:10  <OffbeatAdam> in that, they don't truly know where they're going with the house pain issue.

2009 Apr 08 12:28:26  <OffbeatAdam> some of the best beatles covers i've ever heard.
2009 Apr 08 14:13:57  <OffbeatAdam> ahh
2009 Apr 08 14:13:59  <OffbeatAdam> sitting by the pool.
2009 Apr 08 14:14:10  <jackyyll> what?
2009 Apr 08 14:14:22  <OffbeatAdam> i'm sitting by the pool.
2009 Apr 08 14:14:27  <jackyyll> you've a pool?
2009 Apr 08 14:14:34  <OffbeatAdam> i've an apt
2009 Apr 08 14:14:36  <OffbeatAdam> my parents a pool
2009 Apr 08 14:14:38  <jackyyll> ah

2009 Apr 08 14:14:53  <jackyyll> i have a pool as well.
2009 Apr 08 14:14:55  <jackyyll> its closed.
2009 Apr 08 14:15:06  <jackyyll> sitting by it would be silly, as it is an above ground pool.
2009 Apr 08 14:15:31  <OffbeatAdam> we had a deck around our old above ground
2009 Apr 08 14:15:35  <OffbeatAdam> then we just paid more to get them in ground
2009 Apr 08 14:15:58  <jackyyll> yeah we used to at my old house
2009 Apr 08 14:16:01  <jackyyll> now we just have a ladder.
2009 Apr 08 14:20:33  <jackyyll> so, what do you think about seedboxin europa?
2009 Apr 08 14:38:54  <OffbeatAdam> maybe
2009 Apr 08 14:39:04  <OffbeatAdam> i need to really find out what my boundaries are on the free bandwidth from my friend
2009 Apr 08 14:39:06  <OffbeatAdam> whos giving it to me.
2009 Apr 08 14:39:12  <OffbeatAdam> now that i took off the 10mbit limit
2009 Apr 08 14:39:15  <OffbeatAdam> its a little different
2009 Apr 08 14:39:21  <OffbeatAdam> because if i have unmetered free 10mbps
2009 Apr 08 14:39:23  <OffbeatAdam> and i have a 100meg link
2009 Apr 08 14:39:29  <OffbeatAdam> i have a VERY easy time breaking 10mbps/mth
2009 Apr 08 14:40:13  <jackyyll> ah
2009 Apr 08 14:40:26  <jackyyll> wait what
2009 Apr 08 14:40:30  <jackyyll> 10mbps/mnth?
2009 Apr 08 14:44:45  <OffbeatAdam> unmetered bandwidth
2009 Apr 08 14:44:58  <jackyyll> doesn't that equate to something like 3TB per month:
2009 Apr 08 14:45:24  <OffbeatAdam> something like that
2009 Apr 08 14:45:30  <OffbeatAdam> but bleach7 and bleachforums will be on ehre too
2009 Apr 08 14:45:34  <jackyyll> yea

2009 Apr 09 21:59:45  <jackyyll> yes?
2009 Apr 09 22:00:08  <anpan> any suggestions about the mod rewrite problem?
2009 Apr 09 22:00:23  <anpan> the only thing i can come up with is that we came from apache 2.0 and we're on 2.2 now
2009 Apr 09 22:00:38  <anpan> but i dunno what kind of fix that would require
2009 Apr 09 22:00:45  <jackyyll> i dont know what hte problem is
2009 Apr 09 22:02:31  <jackyyll> (what's hte problem)
2009 Apr 09 22:03:20  <anpan> 12:39:03 pm anpan  http://www.mangatoshokan.com/rss/series/onepiece.xml
2009 Apr 09 22:03:20  <anpan> 12:39:04 pm anpan  http://www2.mangatoshokan.com/rss/series/onepiece.xml
2009 Apr 09 22:03:28  <anpan> same exact .htaccess file
2009 Apr 09 22:03:41  <anpan> works on our old server, not on adam's
2009 Apr 09 22:05:32  <anpan> google shows a lot of results for people having trouble with mod rewrite going from 2.0 to 2.2
2009 Apr 09 22:05:41  <anpan> haven't been able to find any solutions though
2009 Apr 09 22:08:55  <jackyyll> i mean
2009 Apr 09 22:08:58  <jackyyll> it looks like it should work to me..
2009 Apr 09 22:10:56  <anpan> yah that's what i thought
2009 Apr 09 22:11:21  <anpan> the actual path is http://www.mangatoshokan.com/rss?do=series&what=bleach
2009 Apr 09 22:11:47  <anpan> but if you look at the script when it's rewritten, it thinks the get variables are undefined
2009 Apr 09 22:11:47  <jackyyll> whats hte url
2009 Apr 09 22:11:48  <jackyyll> on his server
2009 Apr 09 22:12:07  <anpan> the path?
2009 Apr 09 22:12:15  <jackyyll> the url where it doesn't work
2009 Apr 09 22:12:33  <anpan> http://www.mangatoshokan.com/rss/series/onepiece.xml
2009 Apr 09 22:12:38  <anpan> weirdly enough
2009 Apr 09 22:12:41  <jackyyll> that works..
2009 Apr 09 22:12:47  <anpan> http://www.mangatoshokan.com/rss.xml
2009 Apr 09 22:12:48  <anpan> works
2009 Apr 09 22:12:57  <jackyyll> http://www.mangatoshokan.com/rss/series/onepiece.xml works as well
2009 Apr 09 22:13:20  <anpan> no that's what rss.xml is supposed to do
2009 Apr 09 22:13:31  <anpan> what the series is defined it should only show those releases
2009 Apr 09 22:13:38  <anpan> http://www2.mangatoshokan.com/rss/series/onepiece.xml
2009 Apr 09 22:13:39  <anpan> like this
2009 Apr 09 22:14:06  <jackyyll> i'm not following..
2009 Apr 09 22:15:28  <anpan> http://www.mangatoshokan.com/rss.xml
2009 Apr 09 22:15:34  <anpan> this is the front page rss feed
2009 Apr 09 22:15:40  <anpan> it shows all the latest releases sitewide
2009 Apr 09 22:15:59  <anpan> http://www2.mangatoshokan.com/rss/series/bleach.xml
2009 Apr 09 22:16:03  <anpan> this is the bleach rss feed
2009 Apr 09 22:16:13  <anpan> it should only show bleach releases
2009 Apr 09 22:16:19  <jackyyll> it does
2009 Apr 09 22:16:20  <jackyyll> lol
2009 Apr 09 22:16:29  <anpan> that's on the old server
2009 Apr 09 22:16:32  <jackyyll> ah
2009 Apr 09 22:16:32  <anpan> http://www.mangatoshokan.com/rss/series/bleach.xml
2009 Apr 09 22:16:39  <jackyyll> okay so
2009 Apr 09 22:16:44  <anpan> on adam's it shows all the latest releases
2009 Apr 09 22:16:50  <anpan> which it does when the series is undefined
2009 Apr 09 22:16:57  <jackyyll> okay make rss2.php
2009 Apr 09 22:17:10  <jackyyll> and make it echo the do and the what
2009 Apr 09 22:17:30  <anpan> they don't echo anything
2009 Apr 09 22:17:39  <jackyyll> oh
2009 Apr 09 22:17:39  <jackyyll> so
2009 Apr 09 22:17:47  <jackyyll> the rewrite isn't doing $1 or $2
2009 Apr 09 22:18:39  <anpan> that's what it looks like
2009 Apr 09 22:18:53  <jackyyll> interesting
2009 Apr 09 22:22:04  <jackyyll> hmm
2009 Apr 09 22:22:38  <jackyyll> i dont know
2009 Apr 09 22:22:39  <jackyyll> RewriteRule ^rss\/([A-Za-z]+)\/([A-Za-z0-9]+)\.xml$ rss.php?do=$1&what=$2
2009 Apr 09 22:22:41  <jackyyll> maybe? lol
2009 Apr 09 22:24:09  <anpan> hmm appears not
2009 Apr 09 22:24:22  <anpan> is 2.2 more strict about how rewrite is done or something?
2009 Apr 09 22:24:24  <jackyyll> ya didn't think so
2009 Apr 09 22:24:28  <jackyyll> i have no idea
2009 Apr 09 22:26:01  <anpan> is there a way for me to echo out the url that's it's being rewritten as?
2009 Apr 09 22:26:56  <jackyyll> $_SERVER['QUERY_STRING'}
2009 Apr 09 22:26:58  <jackyyll> $_SERVER['QUERY_STRING']
2009 Apr 09 22:27:46  <jackyyll> but it's likely just
2009 Apr 09 22:27:52  <jackyyll> rss.php?do=&what=
2009 Apr 09 22:28:14  <jackyyll> er
2009 Apr 09 22:28:22  <jackyyll> $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']
2009 Apr 09 22:28:24  <jackyyll> works as well
2009 Apr 09 22:29:54  <anpan> /rss/series/bleach.xml
2009 Apr 09 22:30:02  <anpan> does that mean it's not rewriting at all?
2009 Apr 09 22:30:05  <jackyyll> O_o
2009 Apr 09 22:30:16  <anpan> hmm
2009 Apr 09 22:30:31  <jackyyll> what is that echoing from?
2009 Apr 09 22:30:34  <jackyyll> rss.php?
2009 Apr 09 22:30:43  <anpan> yah
2009 Apr 09 22:30:50  <jackyyll> hmm
2009 Apr 09 22:30:58  <anpan> echo '<!-- ' . $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] . ' -->';
2009 Apr 09 22:31:00  <jackyyll> well that means the rule is working
2009 Apr 09 22:31:43  <jackyyll> just.. not doing the regex groups

2009 Apr 17 20:33:09  <jackyyll> basically, the assholes server im one lets his friend login as root... friend is installing lighttpd apparently.
2009 Apr 17 20:33:14  <jackyyll> which apparently requires him to delete /home
2009 Apr 17 20:33:20  <jackyyll> and delete all users
2009 Apr 17 20:33:34  <OffbeatAdam> ummmmmmmmmmmmmmm

2009 Apr 17 20:33:58  <jackyyll> i guess he thought
2009 Apr 17 20:34:00  <jackyyll> yum install lighttpd
2009 Apr 17 20:34:04  <jackyyll> was way too difficult
2009 Apr 17 20:34:05  <OffbeatAdam> wtf

2009 Apr 17 20:34:38  <OffbeatAdam> fuck that
2009 Apr 17 20:34:45  <jackyyll> so i've been listening to armin van buuren and the likes all day, to be less pissed off
2009 Apr 17 20:34:57  <jackyyll> ASOT 400 and shit
2009 Apr 17 20:35:19  <jackyyll> and i'm installing ubuntu 9.04 RC to fool around with it
2009 Apr 18 22:45:49  <OffbeatAdam> why
2009 Apr 18 22:45:56  <OffbeatAdam> the 9 release isn't an LTS release
2009 Apr 18 22:45:58  <OffbeatAdam> its not going to live long
2009 Apr 18 22:46:00  <OffbeatAdam> maybe a year or os
2009 Apr 18 22:46:01  <OffbeatAdam> max
2009 Apr 18 22:54:03  <anpan> hey adam

2009 Apr 18 22:56:30  <OffbeatAdam> i don't have a computer to transfer things over
2009 Apr 18 22:56:39  <OffbeatAdam> i had to extend the time.
2009 Apr 18 22:56:41  <OffbeatAdam> it fucking pisses me off
2009 Apr 18 22:56:43  <OffbeatAdam> it costs me a lot more money
2009 Apr 18 22:56:45  <OffbeatAdam> that i don't have right now
2009 Apr 18 22:56:47  <OffbeatAdam> but i really couldn't do it.
2009 Apr 18 22:56:49  <OffbeatAdam> i don't have a laptop right now
2009 Apr 18 22:56:52  <OffbeatAdam> i'm at a friends house
2009 Apr 18 22:56:54  <OffbeatAdam> so... if you need something

2009 Apr 18 22:57:01  <anpan> need help doing it?
2009 Apr 18 22:57:12  <OffbeatAdam> its not a matter of help, its a matter of me having a computer long enough for me to do it
2009 Apr 18 22:57:17  <OffbeatAdam> which i won't have until at least mid next week
2009 Apr 18 22:57:20  <OffbeatAdam> what could really help me is money though
2009 Apr 18 22:57:29  <OffbeatAdam> to cover this month's bill.
2009 Apr 18 22:57:34  <OffbeatAdam> i'm literally unemployed
2009 Apr 18 22:57:41  <OffbeatAdam> i'm trying to find a job, but literally got shit canned on wednesdya
2009 Apr 18 22:57:48  <anpan> we're a little short on money
2009 Apr 18 22:57:49  <OffbeatAdam> and i can't afford gas right now
2009 Apr 18 22:57:50  <anpan> how much do you need?
2009 Apr 18 22:57:52  <OffbeatAdam> much less the server
2009 Apr 18 22:57:59  <OffbeatAdam> to be hones ti'm tempted to do a donation drive for myself lol
2009 Apr 18 22:58:19  <OffbeatAdam> http://thepiratesdilemma.com/
2009 Apr 18 22:58:21  <OffbeatAdam> great site

2009 Apr 18 22:58:36  <OffbeatAdam> just know that triton.x-zen.cx is around for another monthy
2009 Apr 18 22:59:10  <anpan> alright
2009 Apr 18 22:59:32  <anpan> do you have enough time to install mtop or enable slow queries for europa?
2009 Apr 18 22:59:38  <OffbeatAdam> its already installed
2009 Apr 18 22:59:39  <OffbeatAdam> i did that the othr day
2009 Apr 18 22:59:42  <OffbeatAdam> sorry forgot to tell youi
2009 Apr 18 22:59:57  <anpan> oh alright thanks
2009 Apr 18 23:00:40  <anpan> also rewrites are acting weird
2009 Apr 18 23:00:49  <anpan> RewriteRule ^rss.xml$ rss.php
2009 Apr 18 23:01:08  <anpan> this works
2009 Apr 18 23:01:10  <anpan> http://mangatoshokan.com/rss.xml
2009 Apr 18 23:01:15  <anpan> but for some reason
2009 Apr 18 23:01:26  <anpan> RewriteRule ^rss/series/hanatoakuma.xml$ rss.php?do=series&what=hanatoakuma
2009 Apr 18 23:01:32  <anpan> http://www.mangatoshokan.com/rss/series/hanatoakuma.xml
2009 Apr 18 23:01:35  <anpan> http://www.mangatoshokan.com/rss?do=series&what=hanatoakuma
2009 Apr 18 23:01:41  <anpan> it's not being rewritten correctly
2009 Apr 18 23:01:50  <anpan> or at all it looks like
2009 Apr 18 23:06:49  <OffbeatAdam> hmm.
2009 Apr 18 23:06:50  <OffbeatAdam> i'm not sure
2009 Apr 18 23:06:53  <OffbeatAdam> did it work in the old place?
2009 Apr 18 23:08:09  <anpan> yah
2009 Apr 18 23:08:21  <anpan> http://www2.mangatoshokan.com/rss/series/hanatoakuma.xml
2009 Apr 18 23:08:46  <anpan> i read that apache 2.2 is more picky with rewriting
2009 Apr 18 23:09:01  <anpan> the old server runs 2.0 if that matters at all
2009 Apr 18 23:09:38  <OffbeatAdam> yes
2009 Apr 18 23:09:40  <OffbeatAdam> 2.2 is much more picky
2009 Apr 18 23:09:42  <OffbeatAdam> thats what it is
2009 Apr 18 23:09:47  <OffbeatAdam> i really don't have time to help you guys write it
2009 Apr 18 23:09:52  <OffbeatAdam> but... you'll need to write it properly
2009 Apr 18 23:09:55  <OffbeatAdam> trial and error really
2009 Apr 18 23:09:59  <OffbeatAdam> there a re a lot of google tuts out ther
2009 Apr 18 23:10:00  <OffbeatAdam> e
2009 Apr 18 23:10:06  <OffbeatAdam> i just know that its wrong the way you have it written
2009 Apr 18 23:10:11  <OffbeatAdam> apache2.2 is more strict on the regex.
2009 Apr 18 23:10:20  <OffbeatAdam> marc should be able to help you really
2009 Apr 18 23:10:24  <OffbeatAdam> he can generally find a lot of shit on google
2009 Apr 18 23:10:26  <OffbeatAdam> so ask jack
2009 Apr 18 23:10:31  <anpan> ok
2009 Apr 18 23:10:34  <OffbeatAdam> if he's even here
2009 Apr 18 23:10:44  <OffbeatAdam> surprised, i'd assume he'd want to hear more about my being fired and thow things were going
2009 Apr 18 23:10:51  <OffbeatAdam> maybe if i kill him
