Website Statistics<br />
<br />
</font><font face="Verdana" size="1">A lot of people have been curious as of 
late to know what exactly is Bleach7's traffic and how do we compare to several 
other large anime websites. So, I am going to try and help answer some of these 
questions by using various tools around the web. Below are some Q&amp;As.<br />

<br />
Q: How many visitors/hits does Bleach7.com get every day/week/month.<br />
A: Well it varies really. We haven't really had any major declines in visitors 
ever since we started the website, it usually averages out for a few months, 
then climbs a bit, then repeat. At the time of writing, the last month or two 
we've been averaging around 50,000 unique hits a day, but different days of the 
week give different results, so it's really hard to tell exactly.<br />
<br />
Q: What kind of bandwidth statistics does Bleach7 use. (Both Website/Media)<br />
A: <b><i><u>Website:</u></i></b> As of the last 6 months, Bleach7 has averaged 
just over 550GB/month on its website server, which hosts both Bleach7.com and BleachForums.com. <u><b><i>Media:</i></b></u> 
Although it's difficult to say at the time of writing since we are 
currently in a server change for our media, in the last 6 months, Bleach7 has 
used an average of over 5 TB/month (TB meaning 1024 gigabytes) for our 
media downloads. We expect this to grow as we have more visitors/members join as 
well as more reliable and powerful servers.<br />
<br />
Q: How does Bleach7 compare in visitors/hits to other popular websites.<br />
A: Thanks to Alexa.com. I was able to use one of their many valuable tools to 
create a graph showing this. We used several popular websites to compare to 
Bleach7, and this graph will update constantly to show a running comparison. The 
websites chosen to use were (BleachForums, Bleach Portal, Naruto Fan, and 
AnimeSuki.)<br />
