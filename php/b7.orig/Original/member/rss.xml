<title>Happy Birthday Bleach7!</title>
<link>http://test.bleachseven.com/index.php?page=member/news&amp;id=1128221169</link>
<description>Well, 1 year come and gone! Only a few grand from 150,000 strong in member count and that's pretty darn good. Alot more than I ever expected. All this week we will be releasing some new things for you guys. But I'm afraid I cant get to it today. I was unexpectedly not at home all day and unable to finish the required tasks before the deadline I set myself. So, we'll make this a mini-release week starting tomorrow. I will also give away the grand prize for September tomorrow and announce the new prizes for October. Thanks for everything, it's all because of you.</description>

<description>Well, after delays again this week.. Here it is and not a moment too soon. I hope you enjoy our release again this week. We managed to make our releases smaller we hope it helps with those of you on dial up or the like. I never realized how much I missed those little bear drawings.</description>
