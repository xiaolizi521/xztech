2. Same place, same day. Earlier.<br />
<br />
The sunlight was in her eyes, and Orihime Inoue shaded them with both hands as she peered around at the tops of the buildings surrounding her. “Kuchiki – san,” she said to her companion, “where is the hollow, again?  I can’t find it.”  She squinted her eyes dramatically and brushed back stray strands of her long hair. Her hair clips reflected back the light with a brighter than natural glow. She was wearing a long green skirt, white sneakers and a Bonta – kun t – shirt that was decidedly tight around her chest.<br />
<br />
Without looking up from her cel – phone sized hollow detector, Rukia Kuchiki pointed to her three o’clock, narrowly missing Orihime’s nose.  “There.”  She replied shortly, her lips drawn up in a grimace.  “It’s acting rather atypically for this type of hollow…” She raised an eyebrow over her lavender eyes and began to chew on her lower lip.  The fingers of her free hand tapped against the studs on the hip of her black jeans.  The polo she had liberated from Ichigo’s closet was too big for her, “Kick – ass Supahstah” stitched onto the left breast.<br />
<br />
Orihime’s eyes crossed as she focused on Rukia’s finger tip, then moved her head to follow the line it dictated, straight to an office building rooftop on the next block to the east.  “Oh!” She exclaimed.  “It’s right… there… Rukia - chan,” she said in a small and horrified voice, “I think it’s feeding!” As if feeling the touch of her gaze, the hollow’s broad shoulders stopped moving.  Its head pivoted on its neck with the unnatural alacrity of a preying mantis, assessing the surrounding rooftops with luminous eyes.<br />
<br />
“Eh?” Rukia’s head rose, her close helmet of dark hair bobbing slightly. Her eyes widened, then squinted.  “It’s got a spirit, someone who died on the rooftop… a jumper…?” She moved swiftly to the edge of the building top, her low boots crunching on gravel as she reached it.  In one agile move she hopped up onto the low wall at the edge and began to stride along it, blind to Orihime’s startled look.  Rukia stopped, the tip of one boot extending out over the sheer drop, tensed her short, lean frame and cupped a hand around her mouth.  “Hey, Ichigo!” she yelled. “Hey!”<br />
<br />
“What!!” An irritated voice drifted up from below.<br />
<br />
Rukia began a series of pointing gestures, sweeping her free arm around, cel phone still clutched in her hand. “Over there!  It’s… Over… There!”<br />
<br />
“What?! What are you doing with your arm?”<br />
<br />
“You idiot!  HOLLOW… OVER… THERE!!” She jabbed pointing hands forward to emphasize each word, bobbled the cel phone and had to perform a difficult snatch – and – wobble maneuver to retain her balance.  Once she was settled in her footing again she blew a sigh of breath upwards, briefly moving the lock of raven hair straying across her face.<br />
<br />
There was a pause. “Oh!” The voice from below said, finally. “The hollow’s over there..?” Rukia growled softly as Ichigo continued his response. “Okay. Make sure Orihime’s ready with her shield – thingy just in case.”<br />
<br />
Rukia began to turn away. “Hey, nice dance, there…!” The voice commented.  She winced, teeth gritting. A red tipped black blur began zig – zag jumps up the cracked and filthy sides of the buildings on the city block opposite their position, climbing towards the hollow.<br />
<br />
“Idiot!” Rukia sputtered, hands clenched at her sides. Then, she snorted a laugh.<br />
<br />
“… so strong …” Orihime said to herself, staring at Rukia’s back.  Rukia looked over her shoulder and tilted her head in a questioning look.  Orihime held out a hand palm – up and shook her head, smiling apologetically.  “Nothing, never mind. I heard him, Rukia - chan…” She clasped her hands and stretched her arms out in front of her. “…I’ll be ready!” She winked.<br />
<br />
An ill- maintained machine in one of the sheds arrayed behind them on the rooftop wheezed and thudded into service, an incongruous back beat as the two women watched Ichigo spring up and over the roof – edge to where the hollow had been feeding.  He landed with his back to them, in a balanced three – point crouch atop the box – like structure of the ventilation system, head up and zanpaku- to held out from his body and behind him by his rigid right arm.  He stood slowly, assuming a half - slouching stance with the brutal cleaver shape of Zangetsu resting on his shoulder.   Rukia and Orihime both leaned forward in attention, observing from the middle distance as Ichigo scanned the open areas of the cluttered rooftop before him; shaking his head, he blurred again as he began quartering the sizable length of the high- rise roof in a fugue of speed.<br />
<br />
Rukia frowned and winced unconsciously at the elevated and ugly rhythmic noises coming from behind her, eyes flickering in an attempt to keep Ichigo in focus. “Something’s wrong,” she said in an aside to Orihime, “he should have located the hollow…” She lowered her gaze to her cel phone to take another reading. Orihime turned to respond, then, distracted, turned her head further to look at the source of the horrendous sound at their backs.<br />
<br />
Simultaneously, the eyes of both women flew open wide. “…BEHIND us!” they screamed in unison.<br />
<br />
The bloody – faced hollow was twenty feet away, doubled over and stalking secretively, quietly as it could, two of six claws clasped over vestigial nostrils to stifle its wheezing, four eyes wide as hub caps as it realized it had been discovered.  It might have looked comical if not for the pale fire of predatory intent gleaming in those eyes and the eviscerated, leaking pieces of a woman, clad in a security guard uniform, impaled on the knife – like skewers of another claw.  The creature reared up, yowling in rage, six bulky arms extended in a murderous asterisk that quivered with rapacious tension. The muscular action caused claw edges to rip completely through the ghost - body and the remains of the poor soul fell with a tragic liquid shlup into a heap at its feet.<br />
<br />
Still screaming, Rukia launched herself and tackled Orihime, carrying her over the side of the building.<br />
<br />
<br />
*<br />
<br />
Ichigo heard the ladies’ desperate voices, and swore violently.  He straightened from his crouched position and promptly struck his head against the underside of the skeletal steel staircase he had been searching under.  He staggered out and across the rooftop to a clear sight – line to the noise.<br />
<br />
He saw the hollow whipping six dagger - tipped arms down through empty air and he briefly glimpsed white sneakers and black boots plummeting out of sight.  Without further thought he threw himself into space after the women, sheathing Zangetsu as gravity drew him down.<br />
<br />
<br />
*<br />
<br />
Even as Rukia was carrying Orihime over the edge of the building, her lips were moving at desperate speed. “Torn feathered sky guard...” She whispered, her voice rising over the susurrus of their passage. She released her companion, physics guaranteeing they in their descent would remain in proximity, so that she could create the necessary patterns in the rushing air.<br />
<br />
“Torn feathered sky guard<br />
Spear wielding demon hunter<br />
Tattered wings that shelter and save<br />
And sweep with zephyrous force…”<br />
<br />
Rukia, shirt flapping up to expose her stomach, one eye squinting and shining in concentration, crossed her arms and swept them outward, pointing with the index and middle fingers of both hands.<br />
<br />
“Mastery spell 27! Arekuruukaze – levitating gusts!”<br />
<br />
There was a sudden increase in their rate of speed and Rukia gasped in consternation.  Then a series of buffeting blasts of wind began to curl around the two, slowing their fall.  Orihime’s cries cut off with a gasp, her open mouth closing with an audible clop.<br />
<br />
Rukia’s shoulders relaxed slightly and she gave Orihime a tight grin.  “That was close, but we should be okay…” She saw Orihime’s eyes widen and she snapped her head up. “That idio…”<br />
<br />
“Craaaaaaaap!” Ichigo struck them both and all three began a fast, tumbling fall down towards the pavement.<br />
<br />
Upside down, Rukia was grasping at Ichigo’s robe and yelling. His sharp features were desperate as he cast around for some way to arrest their fall.  Orihime’s face tensed into a determined mask and her hand fought its way up to her hair clips through the careening drop, even as Ichigo’s foot narrowly missed her nose.  She pushed her hand down, palm towards the ground and the increasingly larger trees, cars and pedestrians.<br />
<br />
In a flash of rainbow lightning, Orihime’s hair clips disappeared. The freefalling three were being circled by the vapor – trailed colorful forms of her shunshun – rikka. Rukia and Ichigo stopped their actions and turned attentive eyes her way.<br />
<br />
“Hingaku, Baigon, Lily…” She shrilled against the wind, tears creeping up the sides of her face, unbound auburn locks swirling a halo around her head. “Santen Ketsuhun!”  Her hand tightened to a fist.  “I REJECT!”<br />
<br />
Three of the “protecting flowers” swooped into a triangle formation between Orihime and the ground and a shielding plane of shimmering spirit formed between the connecting angles of their wings.  The headlong descent of the three hollow - hunters stopped and they fell into a heap onto the slightly yielding, glowing surface of the triangle.  Orihime’s face dissolved into a smile from behind the curtain of long hair that had settled over it.<br />
<br />
One of the remaining flowers, black with a yellow racing stripe, ceased circling and hovered in the air near Ichigo.  Delicate broken chains extended from its tiny finned legs and waved like tails in the updraft generated by its wings. “You dumbass!” it said to him, arms folded and eyes hot above a bandana – mask covering its nose and mouth.  “You’re supposed to be frigging smarter than that.  You nearly killed the women.”<br />
<br />
Ichigo recoiled in surprise and his cheeks reddened.  He scowled at the little flyer. “Who the hell are you?” Rukia cleared her throat loudly next to his ear.<br />
<br />
“Tsubaki.” It moved closer to his face.  “What a bonehead move…” It raised a small finger and pointed between his eyes.  “Do BETTER, jerk.”<br />
<br />
A sudden blow buffeted Ichigo’s head.  “‘Ahem!’” A glacial female voice stated, soft and deadly.  Ichigo and Tsubaki turned their heads, eyebrows rising at the same time.<br />
<br />
“Hand.  Move. NOW.”  Rukia’s eyes were in shadow as she looked down. Ichigo’s hand was on her left breast, from where it had fallen during their confused and jumbled landing.<br />
<br />
Ichigo turned bright red and jerked the hand away.  He bowed his head. “I am SO sorry, Rukia.” He said, as Orihime turned to observe.  After a moment, he looked down at his hand and his eyes narrowed thoughtfully.  “Soft…” he whispered.  Tsubaki rolled his eyes and moved quickly away from the area.  Rukia’s hand was nearly invisible with speed as she used multiple palm – strikes on Ichigo’s chin and gut. His eyes crossed as he gasped and doubled over.<br />
<br />
Orihime turned away from the carnage as the shield drifted the final feet to the ground.  Her lips pursed as she glanced surreptitiously down at her own chest.<br />
<br />
<br />
*<br />
<br />
Flickering shadows flitted across the graffiti – marked cinderblock walls and the noisome collection of trashcans and refuse as the one bare LED bulb in the alley- way attempted to paint on a decaying urban canvas the motion of the shunshun – rikka, slowly circling Orihime. She absently brushed her hair back over her ears and then re – folded her arms tightly below her breasts, shifting her balance between legs, as she took in the tense dynamic between Rukia and Ichigo.<br />
<br />
They were staring at each other, an entire conversation being conducted silently through facial expression and body posture.  A lowered eyebrow, a frown, a shrug and eye - roll, a hair toss and sharp tug at the bottom of a shirt… a declination of the head and snort, the tapping of a foot.  Finally, two nods.  It seemed to Orihime that somehow a fog was lifted.<br />
<br />
Still livid, her irritation illustrated by a sharpness in her movements, Rukia pulled out her phone and checked the screen, pacing along the short length of the alley and blind to the squelching trash.  She jabbed a finger upwards. “Up there Ichigo. Finish this, I don’t want to see your stupid face.” She turned her back to him.<br />
<br />
Frowning, he turned away.  He lifted Zangetsu, allowing the sheath – wrapper to fall away, and stepped to the end of the alley, where there was more space.  “C’mon, old man, give me a boost…” Using the sword’s wrapping, he began to whirl the zanpaku- to in a tight circle above his head until the weapon was a humming blur.<br />
<br />
“Hey.”<br />
<br />
He shifted his stance and saw Rukia looking over her shoulder at him, her face partially shadowed, visible eye unreadable. “Yeah?” The blade twirled on.<br />
<br />
“Hurry up.” The corner of her mouth quirked upwards. “I don’t like being forced to jump off of buildings. Return my honor to me.”<br />
<br />
He met her gaze, brows drawn.  Then he smirked and jerked his chin up. “Yeah. Let’s just say it was an accident and you fell…” He shifted away from her.  “I’ll never tell anyone.”  He looked up at where he was headed, turned back to her and gave her a full smile.  “Except Renji.” He released the soul cutter and Zangetsu sliced the air like an arrow, drawing him upwards by his grip on the hilt.  His laughter colored the air in his wake. The sword pulled him towards the middle of a building across the street, where he landed on the fire escape with cat feet.  He began a climb towards the top of the skyline.<br />
<br />
“Don’t you dare!” Rukia cried after him, eyes haunted by the teasing in her future.<br />
