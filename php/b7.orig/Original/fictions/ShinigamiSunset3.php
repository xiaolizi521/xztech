Ichigo was still laughing as he reached the rooftop and dropped over the edge.  The hollow had fallen again on the food it had carried and its jaw moved busily.  His good humor fled.<br />
<br />
“Yo.” He said, soul cutter resting on his shoulder.  The hollow turned from its half - devoured prey and stretched to it’s full and impressive height. Cold comfort, but it had been devouring a spirit. “I could say that I’m here to help, to restore your spirit energy to the Balance… but I’d be lying. I’m here to kick your ass.”  The hollow moved to face him, the clawed fingers on all six hands flexing, clawed toes digging through gravel and into the concrete below. It tossed it’s head and rushed forward, slavering.<br />
<br />
His attacker slowed to his eyes as he rushed forward, whatever sound coming from its throat was silent to him in his concentration. Zangetsu was a straw in his hand, a twig, as it’s black and silver shape moved to strike.<br />
<br />
The first exchange was swift: overhand left, underhand right, middle left slashing to disembowel and a head thrust with the ripping buzzsaw of a mouth.  Ichigo countered, all wrist and defense, sayai waza, feet planted and almost casual, his blade meeting the claws and batting them away with a muffled sound like knocking on bone with a knuckle. As the hollow thrust its head forward at him again he reversed and struck the underside with Zangetsu’s kashira, snapping the mouth closed with a spray of noisome glop that struck his skin and burned.<br />
<br />
He flowed backwards and to the left, falcon eyes shadowed by the spikes of his hair, and then attacked. Legs driving from the crouch, Zangetsu held parallel to the ground and whipping forward in a battojutsu strike, he passed under the suddenly leaping hollow, sword tip hacking an air conditioning unit apart.  In a blink he was back in guard, watchful and focused, ignorant to the misty spray of coolant behind that prismed in the evening sun and matted down the hair around his neck. The hollow thudded to the ground and then lurched forward. The Soul Reaper went to meet it.<br />
<br />
<br />
*<br />
<br />
“Rukia – chan,” Orahime began, eyes turned skyward, hands cupping the silent flower Ayame.  “This shouldn’t take long, should it?  Ichigo will be right down...?”<br />
<br />
Rukia grinned and flapped a hand.  “He’s probably just finishing up now.”   She turned away, pursed her lips and turned her attention back to her cel phone.<br />
<br />
“…Getting his butt kicked…” Tsubaki opined as he darted by.  Rukia cocked an eyebrow, her eyes sliding back towards Orahime.<br />
<br />
<br />
*<br />
<br />
Again claws flew at him from all angles and his soul cutter and he were one as they responded, a dervish of hot steel and cold intent that began to force the hollow back along the roof with vicious kiri after kiri.<br />
<br />
“I am sooo done with you, bastard.” Ichigo grunted.  The hollow leaped upwards to escape a thrust and Ichigo launched a jumping heel - kick that drove the predator face – first in to the gravel.  Seemingly desperate, it crouched in the small crater of rocks and attempted to overcome his defense by grasping with four dagger hands simultaneously, reaching for any part of Ichigo that could be grabbed.  He blocked one hand with the flat of his sword and grasped the wrist, intending to rip the appendage off.  He used his moving leg to deflect two other arms.<br />
<br />
The fourth soiled hand dug uneven horny knives into his shoulder and began to tighten.  A spurt of blood flumed the air, painting the creature’s hand and speckling his flesh with carmine – colored dots. The hollow raged triumphantly, four eyes wide, bulbous tongue flaying the air in front of his nose as it tried to sponge a taste of him. His teeth gritted and he forced himself backwards in a tremendous push, ripping the points from his flesh in another arterial splash.<br />
<br />
He rose slowly from a crouch, Zangetsu perpendicular to his body and pointing at the enemy, drips from his wound forming an uneven pool amidst the small rocks at his feet. “Now… I’m pissed!”  He tilted his head left and then sharply right, causing a cracking sound.  Then, he moved.<br />
<br />
Making an eye- blink seem glacial, swift to the measurements of atomic time, where God’s metronome is the whoosh of an electron in its orbit, Ichigo Kurosaki, Soul Reaper, moved.  When he was finally still he stood 30 feet past the hollow, leaning on his zanpaku – to; his enemy looked down, saw no wounds and began to take a step.  A slim green line appeared across the hollow’s neck.  The line darkened and suddenly a flood of vile green liquid, possessing the consistency and olfactory characteristics of week – old chunky milk, vented from what had opened into a long gash.<br />
<br />
The hollow screeched, quivering in place.<br />
<br />
<br />
*<br />
<br />
Rukia brandished the cel phone, taking a step towards Orahime.  “Just as I said…” she began, pointing with her other hand towards the flashing indicator light on the hollow – detector LCD screen.<br />
<br />
Orahime’s face lit up with a thankful smile.<br />
<br />
<br />
*<br />
<br />
The hollow pivoted before his view, against the vivid background of the ignited clouds and burning sky; two of its arms began to jerk and then the knees of the stubby legs caved and the creature flopped down onto its side.  The head continued to twitch, the motions growing weaker, digging a small depression in the stones covering the roof with its motion. The liquid slowed to a stream, then to a trickle that continued to mark a path across the hollow’s side and spread tributaries beneath the body.<br />
<br />
Ichigo watched for a time, and then slowly approached the prostrate hollow.  His face grave, he stood over his enemy’s head with his soul cutter upraised, duty - bound to perform the final soul cleansing on the perverted spirit. He took another moment to observe the four eyes of the monstrous figure, trying to discover some trace or remnant of humanity.  Two of the frantic eyes slowly dimmed.  The other two…<br />
<br />
<br />
*<br />
<br />
The flickering indicator on the detector went out.  Immediately, the device made a “boop” sound and a solid light appeared in the exact same location on the screen.<br />
<br />
Rukia’s jaw dropped.  “TWINNER…!?”<br />
<br />
<br />
*<br />
<br />
The lower portion of the hollow’s head exploded outward in a jet of green, jaws agape hungrily, fastening on Ichigo’s left trapezious and clamping down with razors of bone.  He went down on one knee, the tip of Zangetsu wavering, face to the sky and contorted into a wrenching grimace.  The wheezing grunts of the creature thudded against his ears.  It’s two eyes were alight with rage and animal satisfaction as it’s teeth pumped venom into his spirit – body.<br />
<br />
<br />
*<br />
<br />
Black.<br />  
<br />
There is black, and it can be seen that the black is spotted with reflected light and is at the center of a brown eye, bordered with long black lashes and opened wide.  This eye has a twin, and both convey a bone - deep agony, spread wide in their convexity beneath arching black brows, partially obscured by red – orange spikes of hair but emerging as an essential component of a tense and sweating face.  The muscles of the jaw jump and the teeth lock themselves together as this face continues to gaze upwards with currents of apocalyptic emotion.  A sudden curtain rises between the face and all observation.  The curtain is a liquid.  The liquid is red.<br />
<br />
The curtain dwindles for the moment and the face in all its struggle can again be seen, creases at the corners of the mouth, thin lips stretched over grinding teeth and veins throbbing at the temples. The face continues to tell a story, punctuation marks messily dotted and stroked in red ink across its features.   But, the eyes, in a heartbeat they have changed. They have narrowed, their shallow functional depth expanding, connecting to something that defies description; something growing, accumulating and combining as iron filings do when exposed to a magnet.  It is great, great anger. It is power.<br />
<br />
Ichigo Kurosaki’s dark force, his spirit energy, begins to build and flex and push and demand release.<br />
<br />
His face turns slowly to regard the hollow that is attached to him, scything smile inches from his eyes and burrowed into the spirit – matter of his shinigami self.  His eyes narrow further, his mouth drawing into a snarl. His zanpaku – to steadies, cleaver shape rising in his hand. <br />
<br />
The hollow’s muffled voice ramps to a fear- filled insect scream. Its distorted image can be seen in Ichigo’s eyes, eyes that have taken on a lighter color, a glow that washes out the brown but leaves an expanded black center.  The dark force.<br />
<br />
Black.<br />
<br />
<br />
*<br />
<br />
The shunshun - rikka stopped circling and turned their collective eyes skyward with Orahime.  “Impressive.” Tsubaki allowed in a comment to no one.<br />
<br />
Rukia took an involuntary step backwards, her eyes drawn to the rooftop as well, cel phone in one hand and her Chappy – the - rabbit gikongan dispenser forgotten in the other.<br />
<br />
“His strength…” she said, softly.<br />
<br />
“This means he’s in trouble, doesn’t it?” Orahime said. Her eyes closed, and then opened in a purposeful squint.<br />
<br />
<br />
*<br />
<br />
Ichigo gazed at the head of the hollow, teeth fastened onto him near his neck, and he smiled mirthlessly.  A spirit wave emerged from his body and crept outward, sweeping everything before it.  It made contact with the nose of the hollow and the creature’s head was forced backwards despite its best efforts.  Pieces of Ichigo’s spirit – body and shihakusho were ripped free by the reluctantly extricated teeth of the hollow and carried away, to flap like bloody streamers from the predatory spirit’s toothy maw as it was pushed further away.<br />
<br />
The hollow rolled up against an elevator – machinery shed several body lengths from Ichigo and its body spread, four of the six arms moving and the misshapen block – like head waving sinuously on its muscular neck.  The evil looking head was extruded from a bony, skull – like carapace, the top portion of which still wore the torn and ichor – splashed features of the creature’s original form.  It continued to scream as spirit energy washed over it, splayed out against the flexing structure of the shed as if caught against the wall of a spinning centrifuge.<br />
<br />
Ichigo’s head inclined and the spirit pressure ceased.  He staggered to his feet and stepped back.  The hollow tilted its head back and ran it’s broad tongue along black gums to assure that no tasty morsels had been missed.  It pushed up against the wall of the shed, rising to its full height, and then began to shake itself violently.  As the shinigami watched, the shudders extending through the creature’s form caused striations and then ichor – weeping cracks to appear in its shell.  It voiced a long and ululating cry and began to grunt.  Ichigo involuntarily turned his head at the wave of fetor rising from his enemy, but maintained his weakened guard position.<br />
<br />
The cracks grew and then the thick shell of the creature split apart at the compromised areas; an odd movement and some unseen muscular action within the hollow resulted in the ejection of an oddly twisted and asymmetrical hollow with two massive arms and a killing wound across it’s neck. Even as this lifeless creature was ejected, the very substance of its carcass began to sublimate into the ether, soul – stuff drawn into the Balance as any destroyed hollow would.  In seconds there was nothing left of that half of the hollow but a greasy oblong splash on the small stones beneath their feet.<br />
<br />
The streamlined remaining hollow did not wait for the cavities to close over.  Mouth leaking yellow poison and painted with his blood, carapace covered with weeping green cracks, the creature opened its snake – wide, teeth – filled jaws and ran at him. Ichigo was slowed and the jaws might have closed upon him, or a sweeping blow by one of the hollow’s four deadly arms might have ripped through to his spine, if not for the nearly forgotten remains of the ghostly security guard.  Perhaps in one final act of karmic triumph, the charging hollow put a foot down into the remains and slipped, balance lost and sliding to the side.  One uncontrolled arm impacted the shinigami’s zanpaku – to, and the blow to Zangetsu was enough to send Ichigo flying backwards over the edge of the building.<br />
<br />
Again, falling into space.<br />
<br />
<br />
*<br />
<br />
The folds of his black shihakusho snapping swiftly about him, Ichigo was looking up at the sky and the reverse arc of red droplets trailing his descent. He fell into the shadows of the tall buildings around him and his vision dimmed. Before he could focus his will enough to visualize and grab at reitsu – ribbons, or emerge with another solution to his problem with gravity, he was struck on the side and caught up in a gentle embrace.<br />
<br />
“Tch.” The lean, raven – tressed Soul Reaper carrying him clicked her tongue. “You idiot…” Purple eyes took stock of his wounds with concern. “I said to return my honor to me. Not pay for it in your own blood.”<br />
<br />
He laughed, his breath carrying blood and sputum up across his lower lip. “Heh, I’ll be fine…”  <br />
<br />
Rukia Kuchiki, Soul Reaper, wielder of Sodeno Shirayuki, could not help but grin as she flipped in mid – air, her momentum carrying the two of them to a fire escape landing. <br />
<br />
“Thanks, Rukia.” He said, softly. She released her hold on him and he stood unsupported.  He paused, and then looked at her and and jerked his chin upwards. “I’m not done with that bastard.” One bloodstained hand clenched into a fist in front of him.<br />
<br />
She gazed into his eyes.  “I know.”  She looked up and pursed her lips. “Its coming after you.” The hollow was using all six limbs to spider it’s way headfirst down the side of the building.<br />
<br />
Ichigo raised his eyes and began to grin. “Let’s go, old man.” He said and released Zangetsu.  He climbed up on to the waist – high steel railing at the edge of the fire escape and balanced himself, soul cutter held in his rawboned right hand. <br />
<br />
Rukia frowned, her knuckles white where they rested on the hilt of her zanpaku – to.  “Ichigo…”<br />
<br />
He turned his head slightly, regarding her over his shoulder, and winked.  “Hey, what kind of face is that? I’ve still got to get those Japanese Literature notes for third period tomorrow…” The filtered rosy light from the dwindling sun lit half his face, and it seemed that his visible eye glowed. “I’ll be great.” At his feet shadows lay thick as mist in the canyon - streets of Karakura Town.<br />
<br />
Rukia inclined her head. Never taking her eyes from him, she somersaulted past him and jumped her way to the alley far below, where Orihime waited.<br />
<br />
The hollow, spotting him where he balanced, pushed off from the building and fell towards him at incredible speed, just as the setting sun broke free from behind the building.
<br />
Ichigo leapt up to meet it.<br />
