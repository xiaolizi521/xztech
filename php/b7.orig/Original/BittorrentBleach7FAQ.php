<b>Q. When does the anime get released?</b><br />
<br />
The Bleach Anime RAW is released on Tuesdays.  The speed of the raw depends on the distributor of the RAW.  So for a low quality raw, one would look to people such as <a href="http://bt.saiyaman.info/">SaiyaMan</a>.  However for a quality RAW, one would look to people such as <a href="http://www2.l33t-raws.org/">l33t RAWS</a>.  For subbers, there are quite a few of them.  The speed subbers, such as <a href="http://www.hell-fansubs.org/">Hell Fansubs</a>, can have a release either by Tuesday night or early Wednesday morning.  The regular weekly subbers are generally <a href="http://www.bleach-society.com/">Bleach-Society</a> and <a href="http://www.lunaranime.org/">Lunar Anime</a>.  There has been debates as to who is better.  We ask that you discourage from the argument, since most people have heard this debate week-after-week.  There are a few more subbers, who are taking their time with the series. These include <a href="http://www.anime-keep.org/">Anime-Keep</a> and a joined grouping of <a href="http://www.naisho-fansubs.net/">Naisho-Fansubs</a> and <a href="http://www.toriyamaworld.com/">Toriyama's World</a>.  It is up to you whether you want to download either of their works.<br />
<br />
<b>Q. What about the manga?</b><br />
<br />
The Bleach Manga is available anywere between Wednesday and Friday.  Since the manga is more elusive in people releasing, one cannot put a definitive date as to when they release.  Plus, sometimes Shounin Jump, the magazine that Bleach is published in, takes a week off every so often. So it is really hard to say.  As for people scanlating the series, we technically have three groups working on this series; two of whom help out Bleach7.com.  These two groups are <a href="irc://manga7@irchighway.net">Manga7</a> and <a href="irc://maximumt@irchighway.net">MaximumT</a>.  MaximumT is the speed scanlating group.  They generally have a scanlated version within a few hours after the release of the first available RAW.  Manga7 is our high quality scanlating team.  It really depends on when they are able to release a high quality chapter.  The third team, that is working on Bleach is not affiliated with Bleach7, is called <a href="irc://manga-rain@irc.irchighway.net">Manga-Rain</a>.  They prefer that all of their releases be distributed within their irc channel.<br />
<br />
<b>Q. Why have you not updated [insert Bleach7 page here]?</b><br />
<br />
Well, there could be many reason.  One, we don't have all of the information needed to update the said page.  Two, we are working on this site on our own time.  We will get to the said page as soon as we can.  So if you can site back and wait just a bit more, we will update the page.  Trust me in that we want to have Bleach7 the one stop people will go for information on Bleach.  But it is going to take time.<br />
<br />
<b>Q. What is Bittorrent?</b><br />
<br />
Bittorrent is a peer-to-peer program that allows the distribution of files to a large number of
people in a relatively short period of time.<br />
<br />
<b>Q. How does Bittorrent work?</b><br />
<br />
When someone creates a file for use by bittorrent, they create what is called a "torrent file," which usually has an extention ending with ".torrent." That file consists of information about the file or folder that is to be downloaded or uploaded. That information contains information such as how big the file is, the hash information of the file or folder, where the file is going to be uploaded to, and any comments that the creator of the torrent file wishes to have. The file by itself cannot do anything. As stated, the torrent file just has information on where the file is going to be uploaded to. What is needed is for the file to be uploaded onto a server to serve as a basis. This server is called a tracker. A tracker is basically a centralized area that distributes information to a computer stating other ip addresses that are uploading and downloading the file you wish to download.<br />
<br />
Take for example you wish to download a Bleach episode. You click on a link and download a small, generally a twelve-or-so kilobyte size torrent file. However Bleach episodes generally are 170 megabytes. Where did the 169,988 kilobytes go? Well, that torrent file is not the Bleach episode. It is actually a miniature tracking file that is used to help download the file. In conjunction with a Bittorrent program, which I will get to soon, you are able to download the file. Say for example you have already set up a Bittorrent program. When you download that torrent file your Bittorrent program will read where you downloaded that torrent file from. It will then send a message asking the tracker who else has the file you wish to download. The tracker will then respond by sending back a list of ip addresses that are either finished downloading the file and are uploading the file, or people who are currently downloading the file. The Bittorrent program will then send a request to all of those ip addresses asking what parts of the file or folder do each have. The reason for this, is when the original uploader makes the torrent file, he breaks up the file that is going to uploaded into smaller pieces, ranging anywere between two kilobytes to one megabyte and higher. When your program gets a list of what pieces each ip address has, it starts downloading random pieces at a time. So if your file is broken into 1000 pieces, it will download, for example, piece 400, then 675, and so on, until the file is done.<br />
<br />
<b>Q. Where can I download a Bittorrent program?</b><br />
<br />
There are several major Bittorrent programs available on the internet, all of which are free. The original Bittorrent program was designed by the originator of Bittorrent, Bram Cohen. You can download the file off of <a href="http://www.bittorrent.com/index.html">his website.</a><br />
<br />
If you are a fan of Java, there is a fully functional Bittorrent program made entirely in Java. This program is called Azureus. It has many functions for the advanced users as well as a well designed front-end for easy management of all of your torrent files. You can download the file at <a href="http://azureus.sourceforge.net/">http://azureus.sourceforge.net/</a>.<br />
<br />
If you are more of C++ fan, there is another fully functional Bittorrent program made entirely in C++ called BitComet. Like Azureus, this is designed with many functions for the advanced user, as well as a nice looking front end for management's sake. You can download the program at <a href="http://www.bitcomet.com/">http://www.bitcomet.com/</a>.<br />
<br />
For those who wish for just a program, but no real advanced functions, you can download the simple BitTornado. This doesn't have much of a user interface, but it does the job nicely. You can download the file from <a href="http://www.bittornado.com/">http://www.bittornado.com/</a>.<br />
<br />
<b>Q. I've downloaded Azureus, but I still cannot get the program to work?</b><br />
<br />
Like I stated before, Azureus is designed entirely in Java. Java is a programming language that is constantly upgrading and being streamlined. In this case, several functions that were introduced in previous releases, are being dropped for more universal functions. So you need to also download the <a href="http://javashoplm.sun.com/ECom/docs/Welcome.jsp?StoreId=22&amp;PartDetailId=jre-1.5.0_04-oth-JPR&amp;SiteId=JSC&amp;TransactionId=noreg">latest Java release</a>. This download will also enhance any Java programs run on the internet, and is a lot more stable than Window's Java encoding.<br />
<br />
<b>Q. Ok, I've got the program installed, but I keep getting a NAT error?</b><br />
<br />
A NAT error is caused when either a user's computer or a user's router blocks a port. Bittorrent runs off of several ports in order to run. You basically have to open up those ports. These ports include port 6969 and 6881 to 6889.  I will explain how to unlock them in Windows XP, service pack 2. <br />
<br />
To unlock ports in Windows XP, service pack 2, first go to your start button, than to Control Panel. Next go to Security Center. In your Security Center, under your "Manage Security Settings for," click on Windows Firewall. You will now be in your Windows Firewall screen. At the top you should see "General," "Exceptions," and "Advance" tabs. Click on the "Exceptions" tab. Near the bottom, you should see a few buttons. Click on the button that says "Add Port..." The program will bring up a "Add a Port" screen. Next input a name for the port that you want to open. For example, for port 6969 you can say "Port 6969" or something along those lines. It's up to you what you want to remind yourself if you want to change. Anyway, in the next field type in the port you want to add. So to keep with the example, you would type "6969." If the radio button is on "TCP" keep it there else, please click the TCP radio button. Once you have all of that done, just click the "OK" button. When all of the ports have been added click the "OK" button on the "Windows Firewall" Screen and you are done. You may have to reset your computer though.<br />
<br />
<b>Q. What about for routers and Windows 2000, ME, and XP Service Pack 1 users?</b><br />
<br />
<b>Thanks to <a href="?page=member/member&amp;id=Kami5909">Kami5909</a> for this information.</b><br />
To set your IP address within the network, open up your network connections, right click your connection, and click on properties. Select "Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)" and click on properties. This should open up a screen that says "Obtain an IP address automatically" and "Use the following IP address." Select the second one.<br />
<br />
Now, define an IP address. If you're lazy and don't really care, I'll do it for you. Use 192.168.0.111. Type that into the first box ("IP address"). Click on the second box ("Subnet Mask") and enter 255.255.255.0. In the third box ("Default Gateway"), enter your router address (192.168.0.1 for almost all of you). Under that box, there should be two more boxes, "Preferred DNS server" and "Alternate DNS server." We're only concerned with the top one, so put 192.168.0.1 into that box, too.<br />
<br />
You now have a static IP address.<br />
<br />
The next step is to route the ports through your router to your computer. Open up firefox or Internet Explorer (or whatever browser you use, and go to the address bar. Remember your router's address? 192.168.0.1? Yeah, that's not just a bunch of random numbers, it's actually a place that you can visit. So type it into the address bar and go there. It will prompt you for a password. This varies depending on your router, but if you're reading this guide and nobody else in your house has touched it, it's likely to be something like admin/admin or admin/1234. Sometimes it won't even have a password. If you need to, go to your router manual to find out what it is.<br />
<br />
Now, find something that says "port forwarding" or something. It differs from router to router, but it'll be something like that. This is where it gets a little tricky. You have to specify the start and end ports (start:6881 and end:6889 are the ports most commonly used for bittorrent, so go with those for now. You can change them later if you want to, or if your internet provider is blocking those ports. This requires an advanced knowledge of bittorrent, though, so I wouldn't recommend it.) We're not done yet, though, so don't click anything.<br />
<br />
It's going to ask you where you want them to go. This is usually in a box that says "0.0.0.0" on the same line as the one you typed your ports into, so put in the address you specified earlier (Remember? The one we made your computer? 192.168.0.111 if you followed my advice.) Click okay.<br />
<br />
That's it. You have successfully routed past your router. If you still have other crap in the way (firewalls, ANOTHER ROUTER, etc.), I can't really help you, because that's too detailed to explain, but this should help most of you who complain about not getting more than x kbps on a fully seeded torrent with a connection that you KNOW can go faster. If you mess around with this a bit more, you'll figure out more stuff (like how to make your other peer to peer programs go faster =P), but if you don't feel like it, don't, because it sucks if you mess up.<br />
<br />
That's it! You're done! Go test a torrent!<br />
<br />
<b>Q. I'm confused. What do the terms "seeding" and "leeching" mean?</b><br />
<br />
These are terms that basically mean whether a user is uploading or downloading the specified file. Seeding means that you have completely downloaded the file and you are uploading the file for everyone's use. Leeching means that you have not finished downloading the file, but you are in the process of downloading or finish downloading the file. It is a general understanding that you allow the file to be uploaded until you have uploaded as much as how big the file is. For example, if the file is 170 megs, then you should at least upload 170 megs worth. This is generally wavered for people who are still running off of a phone line.<br />
<br />
<b>Q. Where can I find torrent web sites?</b><br />
<br />
There are many torrent web sites out there for many different things. The most common usage is for the transferring of tv and movie files. For anime, the most common place is <a href="http://www.animesuki.com">Animesuki</a>.
For manga, you can find some at <a href="http://www.manganews.com">Manganews</a>. For everything else including Hentai, Yaoi, Movies, American tv shows, etc. you will just have to search the internet.<br />
<br />
<b>Q. I've downloaded the file, but I am getting audio, but no video?</b><br />
<br />
Ok, this is what is called a codec problem. To compress the file into the smallest amount of space, the file is run through a codec. Each Codec is different and there are several out there. Luckly there are several compilation program you can download to get several of the major ones out there. One such example is <a href="http://www.free-codecs.com/download/Codec_Pack_All_in_1.htm">"Codec Pack All in One"</a>. For MKV files, you can download <a href="http://www.free-codecs.com/download/Lazy_Man_MKV.htm">"Lazy Man's MKV Pack"</a>. Finally for those who wish to download the Quicktime only H.264 codec, Quicktime has a version for apple as well as (at the time of writing this) a trial version for Windows. You can download the file from <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/">Apple's Quicktime webpage</a>.<br />
<br />
<b>Q. I heard something about a Supreme Court ruling?</b><br />
<br />
Yes, that was Grokster vs. the Entertainment Industry. Grokster is another peer-to-peer program that suposedly allowed for the transfer of illegal properties. In the ruling, the Supreme Court ruled that Grokster purposely tried to promote illegal activity. However, because of the ruling, some are wondering if Bittorrent will follow the same fate. However, the creator of Bittorrent, Bram Cohen, has been outspoken that he did not purposely create Bittorrent to promote illegal activity. This can be true since companies can legally transfer large files to multiple places within a relatively quick timeframe.  Also a few US Anime Distributors are starting to using bittorrent.  One such example is <a href="http://www.advfilms.com">ADV Films</a>.  They are using the program to help promote current and upcoming properties that they own.</font>
