== NAME ==

londiste - PostgreSQL replication engine written in python

== SYNOPSIS ==

	[londiste]
	job_name = asd

== DESCRIPTION == 

The londiste configuration file follow the famous .INI syntax. It
contains only one section named londiste.

Most defaults values are reasonable ones. That means you can only edit
provider_db, subscriber_db and pgq_queue_name and be done with
londiste configuration.

== OPTIONS ==

You can configure the following options into the londiste section.

job_name::
  Each Skytools daemon process must have a unique job_name.
  Londiste uses it also as consumer name when subscribing to queue.

provider_db::
  Provider database connection string (DSN).

subscriber_db::
  Subscriber database connection string (DSN).

pgq_queue_name::
  Name of the queue to read from.  Several subscribers can
  read from same queue.

logfile::
  Where to log londiste activity.

pidfile::
  Where to store the pid of the main londiste process, the replay one.

lock_timeout::
  Few operations take lock on provider (provider add/remove, compare, repair).
  This parameter specifies timeout in seconds (float) how long a lock
  can be held.  New in version 2.1.8.  Default: 10

loop_delay::
  How often to poll events from provider.  In seconds (float).
  Default: 1.

== EXAMPLE ==

  [londiste]
  job_name = test_to_subcriber
  
  provider_db = dbname=provider port=6000 host=127.0.0.1
  subscriber_db = dbname=subscriber port=6000 host=127.0.0.1
  
  # it will be used as sql ident so no dots/spaces
  pgq_queue_name = londiste.replika
  
  logfile = /tmp/%(job_name)s.log
  pidfile = /tmp/%(job_name)s.pid
