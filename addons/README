Peer 1/Server Beach Addons Repository
=============

Welcome to the Addons Repository for Peer1/Server Beach. This repo serves as a central repository for the development of Addons within the company.

This repository establishes the following folder structure:

REPOROOT
|
--- <addon name>
         |
         ----Branches
         ----Tags
         ----Trunk

Please remember the following:

Trunk - Considered "Current," this is the main development tree. This is the most recent version of the current stable tree. This is not a release.

Branch - Considered unstable, this is a deviation from the current stable trunk. This can be anything, but is almost always a new version - "unreleased" or "unstable" would be considered a new branch.

Tag - A tag is considered a release. When code reaches a launch, the code should be 'frozen' in time. Thus, a copy of "Trunk", which should be Stable at the time of the Tag creation, is created. A common tag would be "1.0" for a version 1.0 release.

Please follow this development pattern if you create a new addon for this project.

This follows the standard of development set forth from the SVN Book, found at:
